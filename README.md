# Simple RAG agent for public SEC filings

This folder contains a simple RAG agent that uses data from public SEC filings by certain big tech companies.
The RAG is done on a per-document basis, and is summarized by the agent beforehand.
Retrieval is done by embeddings, and is reviewed for relevancy by the model before final generation.
