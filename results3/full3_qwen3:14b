retrieval_query=<think>
Okay, the user is asking about how Apple's total net sales have changed over time, with a focus on financial figures like net sales, operating expenses, and losses. So, I need to figure out the best keywords to search for this information.

First, the main subject is Apple's financial data. The key terms here would be "Apple financial results" or "Apple financial reports." Since the user is interested in changes over time, phrases like "net sales over time" or "financial figures trends" might be useful. They specifically mentioned net sales, operating expenses, and losses, so including those exact terms is important. Maybe "Apple net sales historical data" or "Apple operating expenses trends." Also, considering the user might need reports from specific periods, terms like "annual reports" or "quarterly financial statements" could be relevant. They might also look for "Apple financial performance analysis" or "Apple profit and loss statements." I should make sure the keywords are specific enough to get the required data without being too vague. Let me list out the possible keywords and ensure they cover all the aspects the user mentioned.
