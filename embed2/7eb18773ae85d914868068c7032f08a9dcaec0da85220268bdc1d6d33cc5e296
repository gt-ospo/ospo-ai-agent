Services gross margin percentage increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to\nimproved leverage and a different Services mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk\nFactors.\u201d As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.

The Company continues to believe that\nfocused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products\nand services that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was\ndriven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services.

Provision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26,\n2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nJune 25,\n2022\n\nProvision for income taxes\nEffective tax rate\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n\n$\n\n3,624\n$\n15.7 %\n21 %\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nJune 26,\n2021\n\n2,625\n$\n10.8 %\n21 %\n\nJune 25,\n2022\n\n15,364\n$\n16.3 %\n21 %\n\nJune 26,\n2021\n\n11,830\n13.8 %\n21 %\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower\neffective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, partially offset by state\nincome taxes. Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 18\n\n\fThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on\nforeign earnings and an adjustment to prior years\u2019 foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the first nine months of\n2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based\ncompensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and\ncontinued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company\u2019s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of\nfinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the\nCompany had manufacturing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\nobligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the \u201cProgram\u201d). The\nProgram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per\nshare. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company\u2019s discussion\nand analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the\namounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and\nmethods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s\ncritical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company\u2019s exposure to market\nrisk, refer to the Company\u2019s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d of the 2021 Form\n10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 19\n\n\fPART II \u2014 OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cNorthern California District Court\u201d) against the\nCompany alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company\u2019s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, can be affected by a number of\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d When any\none or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of\nthe Company\u2019s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 2.
