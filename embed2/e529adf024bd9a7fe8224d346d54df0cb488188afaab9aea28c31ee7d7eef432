{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 12, "chunk_text": "Based on\nthat decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006\nthrough June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an\ninitial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission\u2019s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending\nconclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the\nEuropean Union General Court annulled the European Commission\u2019s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the\nEuropean Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Note 8 \u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses\n\u201cFulfillment,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d \u201cSales and marketing,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment\nin which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the\nremaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue\ntransactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company\u2019s business\nperformance and manages its operations. North America\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions\nthrough North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. 18\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nInternational\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through\ninternationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these\nonline stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government\nagencies, and academic institutions. Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2021\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\nNorth America\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating income (loss)\n\n65,557\n\n$\n\n64,677\n\n78,843\n\n$\n\n880\n\n$\n\n$\n\n29,145\n\n$\n\n$\n\n189,996\n\n79,255\n\n$\n\n197,473\n\n222,517\n225,124\n\n(412) $\n\n7,477\n\n$\n\n(2,607)\n\n$\n\n90,515\n\n$\n\n83,544\n\nInternational\nNet sales\nOperating expenses\nOperating income (loss)\n\n30,056\n$\n\n27,720\n\n89,812\n\n30,186\n\n(911) $\n\n89,062\n\n(2,466) $\n\n703\n\n$\n\n(5,518)\n\n$\n\n44,422\n\n$\n\n58,718\n\nAWS\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating income\n\n16,110\n\n$\n\n11,227\n$\n\n20,538\n\n31,183\n\n15,135\n\n41,082\n\n4,883\n\n$\n\n5,403\n\n$\n\n13,239\n\n$\n\n17,636\n\n110,812\n\n$\n\n127,101\n\n$\n\n332,410\n\n$\n\n364,779\n\nConsolidated\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating income\nTotal non-operating income (expense)\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax\nNet income (loss)\n\n$\n\n19\n\n105,960\n\n124,576\n\n310,991\n\n4,852\n\n2,525\n\n21,419\n\n9,511\n\n(537)\n\n419\n\n1,798\n\n(14,485)\n\n(1,155)\n\n(69)\n\n(4,179)\n\n1,990\n\n(4)\n\n(3)\n\n3,156\n\n$\n\n2,872\n\n355,268\n\n3\n$\n\n19,041\n\n(16)\n$\n\n(3,000)\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nNet sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar economic characteristics, is as follows (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2021\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\nNet Sales:\nOnline stores (1)\n\n$\n\nPhysical stores (2)\n\n$\n\nSubscription services (4)\nAdvertising services (5)\nAWS\nOther (6)\n$\n\n53,489\n\n$\n\n156,000\n\n$\n\n155,473\n\n4,694\n\n12,387\n\n14,006\n\n24,252\n\n28,666\n\n73,046\n\n81,377\n\n8,148\n\n8,903\n\n23,645\n\n26,029\n\n7,612\n\n9,548\n\n21,444\n\n26,182\n\n16,110\n\n20,538\n\n44,422\n\n58,718\n\n479\n\n1,263\n\n1,466\n\n2,994\n\n4,269\n\nThird-party seller services (3)\n\nConsolidated\n\n49,942\n\n110,812\n\n$\n\n127,101\n\n$\n\n332,410\n\n$\n\n364,779\n\n____________________________\n(1) Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All\nstatements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial\nposition, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual\nresults and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\neconomic conditions and customer spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of\ngrowth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those\ninvestments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we\nowe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes\nof claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory\nmanagement, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions\nand strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and\nadditional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and\nuncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A\nof Part II, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nFor additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
