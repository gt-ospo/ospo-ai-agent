Due to our net loss in the first three months of 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock\noptions, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an\nantidilutive effect on diluted earnings per share. Securities which were anti-dilutive were insignificant and were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods\npresented. Note 5 : Other Financial Statement Details\nAccounts Receivable\nWe sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as\nsales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of\nCash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $500 million during the first three months of 2023,\nand we did not factor accounts receivable during the first three months of 2022. After the sale of our accounts receivable, we will collect\npayment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.

We\nestimate this change resulted in an approximate $360 million increase to gross margin, an approximate $100 million decrease in R&D\nexpenses, and an approximate $525 million decrease in ending inventory values in Q1 2023 when compared to what the impact would\nhave been using the estimated useful life in place prior to this change.

Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Program will be\nreflected in our results of operations.

For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or\nthe marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement.
