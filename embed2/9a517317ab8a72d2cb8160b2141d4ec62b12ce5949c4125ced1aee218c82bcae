Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience,\nand the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated\nfinancial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed\nanalyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available. 17\n\n\fPART I\nItem 1\n\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows:\n(In millions)\n\nGoodwill (a)\nIntangible assets\nOther assets\nOther liabilities (b)\nTotal\n(a)\n(b)\n\n$\n\n16,329\n4,365\n42\n(1,973)\n\n$\n\n18,763\n\nGoodwill was assigned to our Intelligent Cloud segment and was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be\nachieved from the integration of Nuance. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Includes $986 million of convertible senior notes issued by Nuance in 2015 and 2017, of which $985 million was redeemed as of\nSeptember 30, 2022.

The increase in our effective\ntax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. 20\n\n\fPART I\nItem 1\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of\nintangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax\ndeductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to\nearnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign\nregional operations center in Ireland. Uncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $16.7 billion and $16.3 billion,\nrespectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS\nwithdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the\nexamination.", "vector": [[0.04462152,
