These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded\nin accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized\nin earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 30, 2022 and January 30, 2022. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities\nthat are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged\nforeign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 30, 2022 and January 30, 2022:\nOctober 30,\n2022\nDesignated as cash flow hedges\nNot designated for hedge accounting\n\n$\n$\n\nJanuary 30,\n2022\n\n(In millions)\n1,139\n$\n330\n$\n\n1,023\n408\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and\nemployee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have\nnot recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint\non May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10,\n2022. 19\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the\nplaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit\nasserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\nwaste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false\nand misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\nresolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf\nof us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of\ninformation, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly\nfalse, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek\nunspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance\nmeasures. Accounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of October 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based\non our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in\nthese matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.
