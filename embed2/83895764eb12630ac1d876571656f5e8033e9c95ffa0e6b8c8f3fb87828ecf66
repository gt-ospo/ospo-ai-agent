{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 15, "chunk_text": "Critical\naccounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the\ncritical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that\nare significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014\nDescription of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial\nStatements \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,\u201d of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and\njudgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different\nassumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost\nand net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These\nassumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of March 31, 2023, we would have recorded an\nadditional cost of sales of approximately $390 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on\nforecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,\nprinciples, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other\nconditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur\nduring the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to\n\n22\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nchange due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\nbusinesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in\njurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in\njurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our\nstock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\ntheir valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax\nframework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing\nchanges to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for\nwhich that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these\nproceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations,\nand any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022\n\nTwelve Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n\n$\n\n(2,790) $\n\n4,788 $\n\n39,324\n\n$\n\n54,330\n\nInvesting activities\n\n906\n\n(15,806)\n\n(48,582)\n\n(54,313)\n\nFinancing activities\n\n1,990\n\n6,354\n\n11,757\n\n14,082\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at\nfair value, were $70.0 billion and $64.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $13.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(2.8) billion and $4.8 billion for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. Our operating cash flows result primarily\nfrom cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for\nproducts and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from\nour customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended March 31,\n2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to changes in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working\ncapital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category\nexpansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from\nproperty and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and\npurchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $906 million and $(15.8) billion for Q1 2022 and\nQ1 2023, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $13.7 billion and\n$13.1 billion during Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business\ngrowth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital expenditures to decrease in 2023, primarily due to lower spending\non our fulfillment network. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $6.3 billion and $3.5 billion\nduring Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings Inc. in 2022 and One Medical in 2023 with cash on hand. We expect to fund the\nacquisition of iRobot Corporation with cash on hand.", "vector": [[0.018294327, 0.06285821, -0.16246517, -0.00039906998, 0.022416452, -0.015962344, -0.01300463, 0.017516458,
