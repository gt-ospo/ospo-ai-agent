Note 9 :\n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of Tower Semiconductor\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash-for-stock transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for\nanalog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is intended to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our global end-to-end foundry business. Under the agreement, each\nissued and outstanding ordinary share of Tower would be converted at closing into the right to receive $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of\napproximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. We continue to work to close the transaction, which remains subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing\nconditions. If regulatory approvals are not received prior to August 15, 2023, and the agreement is terminated by either party, we may be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee\nof $353 million. If the acquisition is completed, Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n14\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nDivestitures\nNAND Memory Business\nOn December 29, 2021, we closed the first phase of our agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND\nmemory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests in as part\nof the sale. The transaction will be completed in two closings and upon the first closing in the first quarter of 2022, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized\na pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the remaining proceeds of\n$1.9 billion which remains outstanding as of July 1, 2023, and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These\nincentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update\nthe operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and\npenalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics. As of July 1, 2023, we also have a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $201 million recorded within other current assets on the\nConsolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We will be reimbursed for costs of $32 million per quarter in 2023 for corporate function services, which include human resources,\ninformation technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries. Note 10 :\n\nBorrowings\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility\nagreement, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. The\nrevolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of July 1, 2023. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our commercial paper program.", "vector": [[0.048332345, 0.01885856, -0.15037782, -0.04935161,
