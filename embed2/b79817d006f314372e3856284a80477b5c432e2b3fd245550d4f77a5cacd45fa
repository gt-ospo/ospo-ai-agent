The State Aid Decision ordered\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General\nCourt of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September\n25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a hearing was held on May 23,\n2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any\nincremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\u201cForm 10-Q\u201d) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding\nthe potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d\n\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Form 10-K\u201d) under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or\nperiods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the\n\u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance\nmatters, and details related to the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not\nincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction. Fiscal Period\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years\n2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Quarterly Highlights\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company\u2019s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during\nthe third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPad and\niPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n15-inch MacBook Air\u00ae, powered by the M2 chip;\nMac Studio\u2122, powered by the M2 Max chip and the new M2 Ultra chip;\nMac Pro\u00ae, powered by the new M2 Ultra chip; and\nApple Vision Pro\u2122, the Company\u2019s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS\u2122, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024. The Company also announced iOS 17, macOS\u00ae Sonoma, iPadOS\u00ae 17, tvOS\u00ae 17 and watchOS\u00ae 10, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\navailable in the fall of 2023. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 14\n\n\fThe Company repurchased $18.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2023.
