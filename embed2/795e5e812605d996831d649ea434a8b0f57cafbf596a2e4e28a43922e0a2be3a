We expect to recognize approximately 46% of this revenue over the next twelve\nmonths and the remainder thereafter. This excludes revenue related to performance obligations for contracts with a length of one year or less. Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating\nexpenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded\nin accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized\nin earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities\nthat are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged\nforeign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:\nApril 30,\n2023\nDesignated as cash flow hedges\nNon-designated hedges\n\n$\n$\n\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n\n(In millions)\n1,142\n$\n350\n$\n\n1,128\n366\n\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of April 30, 2023 and January 29,\n2023. As of April 30, 2023, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses\ndeferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was\nnot significant. During the first quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment\non other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. 17\n\n\fNote 12 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nThe carrying value of our outstanding notes, the calendar year of maturity, and the associated interest rates were as follows:\nCarrying Value at\nExpected\nRemaining Term\n(years)\n\nEffective\nInterest Rate\n\n0.1\n1.1\n3.4\n5.1\n6.9\n8.1\n16.9\n26.9\n36.9\n\n0.41%\n0.66%\n3.31%\n1.64%\n2.93%\n2.09%\n3.54%\n3.54%\n3.73%\n\n0.309% Notes Due 2023\n0.584% Notes Due 2024\n3.20% Notes Due 2026\n1.55% Notes Due 2028\n2.85% Notes Due 2030\n2.00% Notes Due 2031\n3.50% Notes Due 2040\n3.50% Notes Due 2050\n3.70% Notes Due 2060\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\nNet carrying amount\nLess short-term portion\nTotal long-term portion\n\nApril 30, 2023\n$\n\n$\n\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n\n(In millions)\n1,250 $\n1,250\n1,000\n1,250\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n2,000\n500\n(46)\n10,954\n(1,250)\n9,704 $\n\n1,250\n1,250\n1,000\n1,250\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n2,000\n500\n(47)\n10,953\n(1,250)\n9,703\n\nAll our notes are unsecured senior obligations. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the notes. Our\nnotes pay interest semi-annually. We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium as defined in the\napplicable form of note. As of April 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the outstanding notes. Commercial Paper\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2023, we had not issued any\ncommercial paper. Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply and\ncapacity agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets. As of April 30, 2023, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $7.27 billion. During the\nnormal course of business, to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract\nmanufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us, and in certain instances, these agreements allow us\nthe option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, but these changes\nmay result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. 18\n\n\fOther non-inventory purchase obligations of $3.26 billion include $2.43 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. Total future purchase commitments as of April 30, 2023 are as follows:\nCommitments\n(In millions)\nFiscal Year:\n2024 (excluding first quarter)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029 and thereafter\n\n$\n\n6,667\n1,816\n753\n704\n332\n255\n10,527\n\n$\n\nTotal\nAccrual for Product Warranty Liabilities\n\nThe estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $77 million and $82 million as of April 30, 2023 and January 29, 2023, respectively. The\nestimated product returns and estimated product warranty activity consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended\nApril 30, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period\nAdditions\nUtilization\n\n$\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n$\n\nMay 1, 2022\n(In millions)\n82 $\n13\n(18)\n77\n\n$\n\n46\n16\n(7)\n55\n\nIn connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and\nemployee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have\nnot recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. Litigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint\non May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment\n\n19\n\n\fin the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10, 2022. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the\nplaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit\nasserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\nwaste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false\nand misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\nresolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf\nof us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of\ninformation, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly\nfalse, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek\nunspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance\nmeasures. Accounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of April 30, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on\nour belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in\nthese matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.", "vector": [[0.028537052, -0.023423184, -0.045996852, 0.007451434, 0.0042895,
