In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax\nyears 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. As of September 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in\nour consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these\nissues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax\ncontingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for\ntax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not\nexpected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to\nacquire Nokia\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002\nand are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cFCC Guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege\nthat their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The\nlawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.", "vector": [[0.06581721, 0.059695918, -0.16951282, 0.008388744, 0.05198222,
