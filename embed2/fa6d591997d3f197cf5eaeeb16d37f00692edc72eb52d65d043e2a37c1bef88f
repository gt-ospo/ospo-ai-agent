{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 AAPL.txt", "chunk_index": 11, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 AAPL.txt:The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on\nforeign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was lower compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on\nforeign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits\nfrom share-based compensation. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 18\n\n\fLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and\ncontinued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company\u2019s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of\nfinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of July 1, 2023, the\nCompany had manufacturing purchase obligations of $38.4 billion, with $38.1 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\nobligations are primarily noncancelable. Capital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company had authorized share repurchase programs as of July 1, 2023. The programs do not obligate the\nCompany to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of July 1, 2023, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to\nincrease its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company\u2019s discussion\nand analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the\namounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and\nmethods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s\ncritical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s market risk during the first nine months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company\u2019s exposure to market\nrisk, refer to the Company\u2019s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d of the 2022 Form\n10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) were effective as of July 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 19\n\n\fPART II \u2014 OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) against the Company alleging\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. On September 10,\n2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain\nprovisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuit\nCourt\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\u2019s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction\npending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Epic has appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s stay of the injunction. If the U.S. Supreme Court reverses the Circuit Court\u2019s\nstay of the injunction or declines Apple\u2019s petition, the injunction will take effect. Other Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d When any one or more of these risks\nmaterialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely\naffected. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 20\n\n\fItem 2.
