These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods\npresented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2023 due to seasonal and other\nfactors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. \u201cOther operating expense (income), net\u201d was\nreclassified into \u201cDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized content costs, operating lease assets, and other\u201d on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d), consisting of\nits wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in\nIndia and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between\nconsolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates\nare used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stockbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating\nleases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded approximately $510 million of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role\neliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in \u201cSales and marketing,\u201d \u201cTechnology and infrastructure,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d on our\nconsolidated statements of operations and included approximately $320 million recorded within our AWS segment. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, we recorded approximately $260 million and $250 million of impairments of property and equipment\nand operating leases primarily related to physical stores in 2022 and fulfillment network facilities in 2023. These charges were recorded in \u201cOther operating\nexpense (income), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the six months ended June 30,\n2022 and 2023, we also recorded expenses of approximately $230 million and $180 million primarily in \u201cFulfillment\u201d in 2022 and \u201cCost of sales\u201d and\n\u201cFulfillment\u201d in 2023, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as\nother purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment. 7\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nTwelve Months Ended\nJune 30,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid for interest on debt, net of capitalized interest\n\n$\n\nCash paid for operating leases\n\n349\n\n$\n\n$\n\n954\n\n628\n\n$\n\n1,356\n\n$\n\n1,271\n\n$\n\n2,289\n\n2,088\n\n2,528\n\n4,455\n\n4,995\n\n7,960\n\n9,173\n\nCash paid for interest on finance leases\n\n95\n\n77\n\n202\n\n158\n\n437\n\n330\n\nCash paid for interest on financing obligations\n\n55\n\n41\n\n113\n\n100\n\n198\n\n194\n\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds\n\n3,145\n\n3,735\n\n3,598\n\n4,354\n\n4,682\n\n6,791\n\nAssets acquired under operating leases\n\n5,101\n\n4,104\n\n7,276\n\n7,730\n\n23,531\n\n19,254\n\nProperty and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and\nmodifications\n\n61\n\n240\n\n227\n\n248\n\n3,579\n\n696\n\nProperty and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit\nlease arrangements\n\n986\n\n84\n\n2,351\n\n215\n\n6,117\n\n1,051\n\nProperty and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit\nlease arrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating\n\n1,079\n\n\u2014\n\n1,112\n\n720\n\n1,243\n\n4,766\n\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares.
