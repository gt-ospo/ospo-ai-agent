{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_text": "Such restrictions\ncould include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As\ngeopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of\nexport control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will\nbe adopted. Such controls may be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or\nmore markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options,\nor could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue,\nand financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our\nability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive\ndisadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact demand\nfor our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to\ninclude deemed export control limitations that negatively\n\n40\n\n\fimpact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export\nrestrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China,\nthat negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could\nalso substantially reduce our revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new license requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which\nincorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit\nachieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100,\nas well as any system or board that includes those circuits. We are also required to obtain a license to export a wide array of products, including\nnetworking products destined for certain end users and any system in China that can achieve single precision performance of 200 Petaops, or\ndouble precision performance of 100 Petaops, within a 41,600 cubic feet envelope. We will be required to transition certain operations out of China, which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research\nand development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We have engaged with customers in China to satisfy their demand with products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new\nA800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer\nbut have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell\nproducts that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. Our revenue, profitability, cash flows, and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative\nproduct offerings, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, or if the USG does not grant licenses in\na timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or\nimpose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the\nlicensing process will make our sales and support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue\nalternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. Restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. Additionally, revisions to laws or\nregulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import\nduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Furthermore, a tariff exclusion on our graphics cards is scheduled to expire in December 2022. If we\nare unable to obtain an extension of this tariff exclusion, or if the value of our graphics cards increases due to our adoption of a change in tariff\nvaluation methodology, our profitability may be negatively impacted.
