(SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business\nfor $9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND\nOpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests in as part of the sale. The transaction will be completed in two\nclosings and upon first closing in the first three months 2022, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized a pre-tax gain\nof $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the\nremaining proceeds of $1.9 billion which remains outstanding as of April 1, 2023, and will be received upon the second closing of the\ntransaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of\nthe NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in\nthe aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the\ncurrent business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our\nexpectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics. As of April 1, 2023, we also have a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $184 million recorded\nwithin other current assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We will be reimbursed for costs of approximately $35 million\nper quarter in 2023 for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and\nother compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries. Note 9 : Borrowings\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also amended both our 5-year\n$5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day credit facility\nagreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. The revolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of April 1, 2023. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our commercial paper program. In the\nfirst quarter of 2023, we settled in cash $2.9 billion of our commercial paper and had $1.0 billion outstanding as of April 1, 2023. Our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified\nredemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment\nwith all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Level 2 investments consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time\ndeposits, and notes and bonds issued by financial institutions. Level 1 investments consist primarily of US Treasury securities. Level 2 investments consist primarily of non-US government debt. The fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nOur non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and\nproperty, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current\nperiod. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we\nclassify these assets as Level 3. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method\ninvestments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with\noriginal maturities greater than three months, and issued debt. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n15\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nWe classify the fair value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as\nLevel 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants\nreceivable as of April 1, 2023 was $459 million (the aggregate carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $437 million). The aggregate\ncarrying value of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of April 1, 2023 was $0 million (the\naggregate carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $400 million). We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding any commercial paper) as Level 2. The fair value of our issued debt was $45.9 billion\nas of April 1, 2023 ($34.3 billion as of December 31, 2022).
