{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 13, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt:Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed over the long-term, if there are\nfurther changes in the USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and\nlicensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our\ninventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding\nus from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. Our sales to China will decrease\nsignificantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including\nChina, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic\nand geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While\ndifficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs\nfor capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term\nchanges in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors. Israel\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our\napproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our\nnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted\nemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have been called-up for active military duty in\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate period, which may cause disruption to our\nproduct development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our\nbusiness; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for\nour business.

These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and\n\n27\n\n\fservices to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago and up 34% sequentially. Data Center revenue was up 279% from a year ago and up 41% sequentially. Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by global\ndemand for the training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Data Center\ncompute grew 324% from a year ago and 38% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp of our Hopper GPU architecture-based HGX\nplatform from cloud service providers, or CSPs, including GPU-specialized CSPs; consumer internet companies; and enterprises. Our sales of\nAmpere GPU architecture-based Data Center products were significant but declined sequentially, as we approach the tail end of this\narchitecture. We recognized initial revenue on the ramp of our L40S GPU and the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for a broad range of\ncustomers. CSPs drove roughly half of Data Center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the\nother half. Networking was up 155% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to\nsupport our HGX platform. Gaming revenue was up 81% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially. Strong year-on-year growth reflects higher sell-in to partners following\nnormalization of channel inventory levels. Sequential growth reflects strong demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for back-to-school\nand the start of the holiday season. Professional Visualization revenue was up 108% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sell-in to\npartners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise workstation\ndemand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture. Automotive revenue was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto\ncockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by sales of self-driving platforms. Gross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, driven by improved product mix from Data Center revenue growth and\nlower net inventory provisions and related charges. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and related charges were $681 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture\nproducts. The net inventory provisions were $442 million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 2.4 percentage points. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, provisions for inventory and related charges were $702 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million. The net inventory provisions were $681\nmillion and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 11.5 percentage points. Operating expenses were up 16% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based\ncompensation, primarily reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases. Market Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $14.51 billion, up 279% from a year ago and up 41% from the previous quarter. We announced NVIDIA HGX H200 with the H200 Tensor Core GPU; introduced an AI foundry service, first available on Microsoft Azure;\nannounced that the NVIDIA Spectrum-X will be integrated into servers from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo in the\nfirst quarter of next year; announced that NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips will power more than 40 new supercomputers and began\nshipping in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; and partnered with a range of leading companies on AI initiatives, including Amdocs, Dropbox,\nFoxconn, Genentech (member of Roche Group), Infosys, Lenovo, Reliance Industries, Scaleway, and Tata Group. Gaming revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $2.86 billion, up 81% from a year ago and up 15% from the previous quarter. We\nlaunched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction; released TensorRT-LLM for Windows; added 56 DLSS games and over 15 Reflex games; and\nsurpassed 1,700 games on GeForce NOW. 28\n\n\fProfessional Visualization revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $416 million, up 108% from a year ago and up 10% from the\nprevious quarter. We announced a new line of desktop workstations with NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX smart\ninterface cards. Automotive revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $261 million, up 4% from a year ago and up 3% from the previous quarter. We\nfurthered our collaboration with Foxconn to develop next-generation electric vehicles.
