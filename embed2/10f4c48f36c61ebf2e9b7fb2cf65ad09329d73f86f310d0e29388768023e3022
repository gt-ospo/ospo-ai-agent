Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2022. This was primarily due to net\nproceeds from our debt issuance, net of debt and commercial paper repayments, proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares, proceeds from partner contributions and reduced\ndividend payments in the first nine months of 2023. MD&A\n\n38\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between\nperiods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating\nour business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax\neffects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year\nnon-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax\npositions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of\nreasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates\ncomparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively\nadjusted to reflect this updated approach. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results\ncalculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Non-GAAP\nadjustment or\nmeasure\n\nDefinition\n\nUsefulness to management and investors\n\nAcquisition-related\nadjustments\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nconsists of amortization of intangible assets such as\ndeveloped technology, brands, and customer\nrelationships acquired in connection with business\ncombinations. Charges related to the amortization of\nthese intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales\nand MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated\nuseful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and\nthus are generally recorded over multiple years. Share-based\ncompensation\n\nShare-based compensation consists of charges related We exclude charges related to share-based\nto our employee equity incentive plans. compensation for purposes of calculating certain nonGAAP measures because we believe these adjustments\nprovide better comparability to peer company results\nand because these charges are not viewed by\nmanagement as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a\nuseful view, through the eyes of management, of our\ncore business model, how management currently\nevaluates core operational performance, and additional\nmeans to evaluate expense trends, including in\ncomparison to other peer companies. Restructuring and\nother charges\n\nRestructuring charges are costs associated with a\nformal restructuring plan and are primarily related to\nemployee severance and benefit arrangements. Other\ncharges may include periodic goodwill and asset\nimpairments, certain pension charges, and costs\nassociated with restructuring activity. Q3 2023 includes\nan EC-imposed fine and a fee related to the termination\nof our agreement to acquire Tower. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including\nany adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods,\nfor purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures\nbecause these costs do not reflect our core operating\nperformance. These adjustments facilitate a useful\nevaluation of our core operating performance and\ncomparisons to past operating results and provide\ninvestors with additional means to evaluate expense\ntrends. (Gains) losses on\nequity investments,\nnet\n\n(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of\nongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable\nequity securities, observable price adjustments on nonmarketable equity securities, related impairment\ncharges, and the sale of equity investments and other. We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for\npurposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures\nbecause it provides better comparability between\nperiods. The exclusion reflects how management\nevaluates the core operations of the business. MD&A\n\nWe exclude amortization charges for our acquisitionrelated intangible assets for purposes of calculating\ncertain non-GAAP measures because these charges are\ninconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the\ntiming and valuation of our acquisitions. These\nadjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current\noperating performance and comparison to our past\noperating performance and provide investors with\nadditional means to evaluate cost and expense trends. 39\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nGains (losses) from\ndivestiture\n\nGains (losses) are recognized at the close of a\ndivestiture, or over a specified deferral period when\ndeferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer\nmanufacturing and sale agreement entered into in\nconnection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND\nmemory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of\nthe initial closing consideration was deferred and will be\nrecognized between first and second closing. We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures\nfor purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures\nbecause they do not reflect our current operating\nperformance. These adjustments facilitate a useful\nevaluation of our current operating performance and\ncomparisons to past operating results.", "vector": [[0.09383236, 0.053585988, -0.15226407, -0.0742528,
