{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 19, "chunk_text": "The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in Q3 2022, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased product and\nshipping costs resulting from increased sales, increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased transportation costs, and increased wage rates. The\nincrease in cost of sales in absolute dollars for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to\nincreased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased transportation costs, increased\nwage rates and incentives, and fulfillment network inefficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $3.6 billion for Q3 2022, and by\n$7.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our\ncustomers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $18.1 billion and $19.9 billion in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022,\nand $53.0 billion and $58.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the\nextent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer\nadditional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network,\nnegotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to\nour future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and content\u201d as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our\ninternal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. 26\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical\nstores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in \u201cFulfillment,\u201d\nAWS costs are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and content.\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment\nprocessing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent\nto which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment\nservices provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing\nimprovements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and\nrelated transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of\nunderlying transactions.", "vector": [[0.02060138, 0.10662872, -0.13399707, -0.03269359, 0.056448244, -0.034414973, 0.008553494, -0.016523568, 0.072600625, 0.047886666,
