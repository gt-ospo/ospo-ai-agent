Total video and music expense was $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $9.4 billion and $11.4 billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service\nperiod. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31,\n2021 was $14.0 billion, of which $10.1 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Included in \u201cOther long-term\nliabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that\nhave not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet\nrecognized were $104.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount\nand timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Acquisition Activity\nOn March 17, 2022, we acquired MGM Holdings Inc. (\u201cMGM\u201d), for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired, to provide\nmore digital media content options for customers. We also assumed $2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid immediately after closing. The acquired assets\nprimarily consist of $3.4 billion of video content and $4.9 billion of goodwill, the majority of which is allocated to our North America segment. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the MGM acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of\noperations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. 9\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nNote 2 \u2014 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash,\nAAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash\nequivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following\nhierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1\u2014Valuations based on quoted
