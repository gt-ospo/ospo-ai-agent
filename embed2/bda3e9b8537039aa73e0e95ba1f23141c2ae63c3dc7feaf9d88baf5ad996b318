Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements\nreflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. These condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal\nyears 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
