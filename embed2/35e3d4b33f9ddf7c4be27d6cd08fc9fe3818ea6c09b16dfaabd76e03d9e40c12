Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2022\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $76 million or 5% driven by legal expenses.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2022\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields and higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to the issuance of\ncommercial paper. Net recognized losses on investments increased due to losses on equity securities in the current period as opposed to\ngains in the prior period. Net gains on derivatives increased due to higher gains on equity derivatives. 36\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate was 18% and 19% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in our\neffective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and U.S. Treasury\nDepartment, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings\ntaxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional\noperations center in Ireland. Uncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023,\nwe received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer\npricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we\nbelieve our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the\nNOPAs through the IRS\u2019s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these\nissues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our\nincome tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for\ntax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected\nto be material to our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to\nbe sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share\nrepurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), for at least\nthe next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $144.0 billion and $111.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023,\nrespectively. Equity investments were $11.4 billion and $9.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Our short-term\ninvestments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade\nfixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated\nsecurities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest\nrate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that\ncorrelate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments\nheld are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. 37\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nValuation\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our\nfinancial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and\npreferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value,\nthen we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\nindirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency\nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3\ninvestments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.", "vector": [[0.09229456, 0.043852985, -0.16308266,
