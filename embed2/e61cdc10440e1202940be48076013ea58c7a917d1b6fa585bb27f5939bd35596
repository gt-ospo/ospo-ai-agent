Income tax as a percentage of\nincome before income tax was an expense of 12.2% and 11.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a\nbenefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. 32\n\n\fThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based\ncompensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax\nrate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and\ncredit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio. Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,\ndue to growth in revenue, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balance and taxes paid. Accounts receivable balance in the third quarter\nof fiscal year 2024 reflected approximately $570 million from customer payments received ahead of the invoice due date. Cash provided by investing activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,\nprimarily driven by lower marketable securities maturities. Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, due\nto a debt repayment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share\nrepurchases. Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of\nOctober 29, 2023, we had $18.28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt\nsecurities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as\ncertificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to\nNote 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to\nmeet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our debt obligations, future supply\nobligations and vendor and supplier prepayments. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external\ncapital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements. Except for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued\nany related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities held outside of the U.S. as of October 29, 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We\n\n33\n\n\fpaid $4.35 billion in cash taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, largely for previously deferred federal income tax payments related to the\ndisaster relief made available by the IRS for certain California taxpayers. Capital Return to Shareholders\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively, in share repurchases\nand $99 million and $296 million, respectively, in cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our\nBoard of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.", "vector": [[0.06055409, 0.027358754, -0.12432207, -0.01950448, 0.018160561, 0.0010146872, -0.004109448,
