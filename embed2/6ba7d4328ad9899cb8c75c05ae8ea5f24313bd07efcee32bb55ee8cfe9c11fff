During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we paid $100 million and $300 million in cash dividends to our\nshareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of\nDirectors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our\nshareholders. Note 15 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on\nan operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive artificial intelligence, or\nAI, Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for\nrobotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud. The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and\nsolutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and\nvirtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet\napplications. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged\nacross our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. The \u201cAll Other\u201d category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of\nmaking operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate\ninfrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, intellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost,\nand other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense\ndirectly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, our CODM does not evaluate\ndepreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our\nreportable segments and the \u201cAll Other\u201d category. 22\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nCompute &\nNetworking\n\nGraphics\n\nAll Other\n\nConsolidated\n\n(In millions)\nThree Months Ended October 29, 2023\nRevenue\nOperating income (loss)\n\n$\n$\n\n14,645\n10,262\n\n$\n$\n\n3,475\n1,493\n\n$\n$\n\n\u2014 $\n(1,338) $\n\n18,120\n10,417\n\nThree Months Ended October 30, 2022\nRevenue\nOperating income (loss)\n\n$\n$\n\n3,816\n1,086\n\n$\n$\n\n2,115\n606\n\n$\n$\n\n\u2014 $\n(1,091) $\n\n5,931\n601\n\nNine Months Ended October 29, 2023\nRevenue\nOperating income (loss)\n\n$\n$\n\n29,507\n19,149\n\n$\n$\n\n9,312\n3,751\n\n$\n$\n\n\u2014 $\n(3,542) $\n\n38,819\n19,358\n\nNine Months Ended October 30, 2022\nRevenue\nOperating income (loss)\n\n$\n$\n\n11,395\n3,509\n\n$\n$\n\n9,528\n3,739\n\n$\n$\n\n\u2014 $\n(4,280) $\n\n20,923\n2,968\n\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 29,\nOctober 30,\n2023\n2022\n\nNine Months Ended\nOctober 29,\nOctober 30,\n2023\n2022\n\n(In millions)\nReconciling items included in \"All Other\" category:\nStock-based compensation expense\nUnallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses\nAcquisition-related and other costs\nIP-related costs\nAcquisition termination cost\nOther\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n23\n\n(979) $\n(198)\n(135)\n(26)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(1,338) $\n\n(745) $\n(156)\n(174)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(16)\n(1,091) $\n\n(2,555) $\n(515)\n(446)\n(36)\n\u2014\n10\n(3,542) $\n\n(1,971)\n(432)\n(499)\n\u2014\n(1,353)\n(25)\n(4,280)\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based upon the billing location of the customer.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set\nforth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, and our Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023 under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of such reports, and our\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. Overview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nSince our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of\nthe PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA\nis now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry. Our two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To\nmeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our\nsupply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity\narrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. 25\n\n\fWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity\ncommitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand\nexpectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles or enter new lines of business, which may\nrequire us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the\narchitecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch\ncadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges\nassociated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can\ncreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and\nquality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay\nfurther production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our\ntechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, thirdparty large language models, and generative AI models. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services\ndirectly and through our network of partners, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI\nmodels, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services\ncan be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use\ncases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand\nfor Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Global Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.", "vector": [[0.025580497, -0.0054789977,
