This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change\nfor a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or\nchanges to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term\noperating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides\nuseful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP results have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this\nupdated approach. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should\nbe carefully evaluated.

Charges related to the amortization of\nthese intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales\nand MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated\nuseful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and\nthus are generally recorded over multiple years. We exclude amortization charges for our acquisitionrelated intangible assets for purposes of calculating\ncertain non-GAAP measures because these charges\nare inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by\nthe timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These\nadjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current\noperating performance and comparison to our past\noperating performance and provide investors with\nadditional means to evaluate cost and expense trends. Share-based\ncompensation\n\nShare-based compensation consists of charges related\nto our employee equity incentive plans.

We believe these adjustments provide investors with a\nuseful view, through the eyes of management, of our\ncore business model, how management currently\nevaluates core operational performance, and additional\nmeans to evaluate expense trends, including in\ncomparison to other peer companies.

Our risk management\nprograms are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and\nsensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to\n\"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nRisk Factors\nThe risks described in \"Risk Factors\" within Other Key Information in our 2022 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not\nidentify all risks that we face\u2014our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently\nconsider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a\nreliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also\nto the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and Consolidated Condensed\nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Details sections. Controls and Procedures\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how\nwell-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The\ndesign of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on management\u2019s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of\nthe period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange\nAct)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and\nis accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,\nto allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) that occurred during the quarter ended April 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase\nshares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending April 1,\n2023. As of April 1, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available. We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common\nstock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock\nrepurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common\nstock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program. Other Key Information\n\n37\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nSection 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions\nduring the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March\n2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one\nsuch sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in\norder to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the US\nDepartment of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated\nwith any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, Intel suspended all business operations in Russia until further\nnotice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security\nfirm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive\nTechnologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a\nlicense issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such\nactivities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.
