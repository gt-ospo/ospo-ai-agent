APPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\n1. General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these \u201cTerms\u201d) apply to a particular restricted stock unit\naward (the \u201cAward\u201d) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant\n(the \u201cGrant Notice\u201d) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\n\u201cParticipant.\u201d The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the \u201cAward Date.\u201d The Award was granted\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Capitalized terms\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\nas the \u201cAward Agreement\u201d applicable to the Award. 2. RSUs. As used herein, the term \u201cRSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\ndetermination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall not\nbe treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind. 3. Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \u201cVesting Date.\u201d) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited. 4. Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Vesting Commencement\nDate and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any\nproportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of\nabsence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as\napproved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal\nleave of absence. Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant\u2019s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant\u2019s other\ncompensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant\nwithout the Participant\u2019s consent thereto. 1\n\n\f5.\n\nDividend and Voting Rights. (a) Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nstock as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares. (b)\nDividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its\nShares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its\nShares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to\nthe Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a \u201cDividend Equivalent Right\u201d).", "vector": [[0.051106088, 0.023507176, -0.14401335, -0.01070449, -0.004339045, 0.0024124652,
