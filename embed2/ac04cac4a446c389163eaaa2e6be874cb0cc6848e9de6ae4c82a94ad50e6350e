{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 28, "chunk_text": "We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize\nadditional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of\njurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online\ncommerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes\non online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions\nhave proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue\nunless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us\nprospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide\ninformation about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not\nhave sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\nbusinesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to\nrealize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to\nour forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the\nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or\nother tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for\nprior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial,\nadministrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, in February 2023, the Indian tax authority determined that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this\ndetermination; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our\ntaxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our\ntax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be\nmaterially different from our historical tax accruals. 44\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements\nrelating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any\nviolations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of\npayments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are\nsubject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. 45\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nItem 2.
