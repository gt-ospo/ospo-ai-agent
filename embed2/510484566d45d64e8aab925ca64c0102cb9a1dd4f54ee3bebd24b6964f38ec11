DCAI Revenue $B\n\nDCAI Operating Income (Loss) $B\n\nRevenue Summary\nQ2 2023 vs. Q2 2022\nRevenue was $4.0 billion, down $691 million from Q2 2022, driven by a decrease in server revenue. Server volume decreased 34% in Q2 2023, due to lower demand in a\nsoftening CPU data center market. Server ASPs increased 17% primarily due to a higher mix of high core count products. The decrease in server revenue was partially offset by\nan increase in revenue from the FPGA product line. YTD 2023 vs YTD 2022\nRevenue was $7.7 billion, down $3.0 billion from YTD 2022, driven by a decrease in server revenue. Server volume decreased 43% in YTD 2023, due to lower demand and from\ncustomers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening CPU data center market. Server ASPs increased 8% primarily due to a higher mix of high core count\nproducts. The decrease in server revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the FPGA product line.
