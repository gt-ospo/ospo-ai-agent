Note 7 :\n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n\nAcquisitions\nPending acquisition of Tower Semiconductor\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash for stock transaction expected to close within twelve\nmonths from the date of the agreement. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our\nglobal end-to-end foundry business. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding ordinary share of Tower will\nbe converted into the right to receive $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. This transaction is subject to\ncertain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. If the agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals,\nwe will be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million.

(SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. The NAND memory business includes our NAND\nmemory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND\nmemory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business). The transaction will be completed in two closings. The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021. At first closing, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration, with the remaining $2.0 billion to be received by the second closing of\nthe transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. In connection with the first closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within Interest and other, net, and tax expense\nof $495 million. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, $583 million of the first closing consideration was deferred and will be\nrecognized between the first and second closing within Interest and other, net. At the first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to\nseparately created wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel. The equity interest of the NAND OpCo Business will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing. In connection with the first closing,\nwe and certain affiliates of SK hynix also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory\nwafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing. We have concluded based on the terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries\nare variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary, because the governance structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most\nsignificantly impact their economic performance. In line with this conclusion, we fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business, and recorded a receivable for\nthe remaining proceeds of $1.9 billion in Other long-term assets, which remains outstanding as of October 1, 2022. The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets as of the first closing date included the following:\n(In Millions)\n\nDec 29, 2021\n\nInventories\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n$\n\nTotal sold\n\n$\n\n941\n6,018\n6,959\n\nThe wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives\nand penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan\nof the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our\nexpectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.", "vector": [[0.044474456, 0.10824483, -0.18024905, -0.03535641,
