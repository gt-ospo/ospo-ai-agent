{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 22, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt:We face\nadditional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management\u2019s\nattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the\nassets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring. Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\n\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,\nincluding key personnel, of the acquired business;\n\n\u2022\n\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n\n\u2022\n\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\n\u2022\n\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\n40\n\n\f\u2022\n\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\nunable to close an acquisition;\n\n\u2022\n\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\ncovenants or other restrictions;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n\n\u2022\n\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n\n\u2022\n\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n\n\u2022\n\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target\u2019s employees, vendors and customers. For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\npersonnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\nsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these End\nCustomers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to\nCustomer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total revenue\nfor the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these\nchannel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\nour products, all of which may alter partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. Our sales to Customer A and Customer B were largely in\nsupport of two End Customers.", "vector": [[0.008995523, 0.08753879, -0.13396542, -0.005340641, 0.05234272, -0.022679405, 0.025309213,
