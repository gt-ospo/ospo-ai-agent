We repurchased 18.6 million shares of\nour common stock for $2.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of our common stock\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program. Stock Award Activity\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023. These\ntotals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the\napplicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,\nchanges in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be\nmore or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax\nrate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our\nability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. For 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development\ncredit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and\nmay cause variability in our effective tax rate. Our income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $1.4 billion, which included $2.1 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily\nattributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $948\nmillion, which included $48 million of net discrete tax expense. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $453 million and $619 million in Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, tax contingencies were approximately $4.0 billion and $4.2 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and\nuncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income\ntax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019\ntax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These\nexaminations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination\nas well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the\nUnited Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular\njurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and\ncharacterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (\u201cLTA\u201d) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the\nU.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA\u2019s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In February 2023, we received a decision by the Indian tax authority (\u201cITA\u201d) that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will\nneed to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is resolved, which payments could be significant in the\naggregate. We believe the ITA\u2019s decision is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If\nthis matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.", "vector": [[0.054958075, 0.029742343, -0.14144965, -0.025461085,
