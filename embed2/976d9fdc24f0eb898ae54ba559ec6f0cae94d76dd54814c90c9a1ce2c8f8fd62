{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 38, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt:An estimated loss from a loss\ncontingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate,\namong other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred\ntax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements\nfrom such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required\nin assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 41\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing\noverhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of\ncompletion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers,\nand the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development\nplans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we\nreduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 42\n\n\fPART I\nItem 3, 4\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRISKS\nWe are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to\nmanage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily\nto maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro,\nJapanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average\nmaturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broadbased indices to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nhave evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these\ndisclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter\nended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting. 43\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1, 1A\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRefer to Note 13 \u2013 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal\nproceedings in which we are involved. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating\nmargins. Competition in the technology sector\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized\nfirms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry\nin many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies,\nshifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in\nmaking innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse\nsolutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that\ncan accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face\nsignificant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. \u2022\n\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and\nrelated services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles,\nwearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the\nhardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be\nable to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated\nhardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we\nincrease our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. \u2022\n\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from\ncompeting platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices\ncompete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning\nto these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these\ndevices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract\napplication developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may\ndecrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their\ncompetitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer\n(\u201cOEM\u201d) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. 44\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\n\u2022\n\nCompeting platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility\nof content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move\ndata and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to\nwrite applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors\u2019 content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\noperating margins. Competitors\u2019 rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute\nproducts and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives. Business model competition\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. \u2022\n\nEven as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the licensebased proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting\noriginal ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue\nreceived from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers\nunder this model. \u2022\n\nWe are investing in artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities into our\nconsumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving\nmarket. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and\nservices necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological\nchange, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.", "vector": [[-0.008291762, 0.08316957, -0.12616076, 0.021645648,
