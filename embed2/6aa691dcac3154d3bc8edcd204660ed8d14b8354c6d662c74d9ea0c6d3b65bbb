The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should\nbe read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 29, 2023 and Part II, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. Overview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nSince our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of\nthe PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA\nis now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry. Our two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last two quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. In\norder to meet this demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers may create more supply chain complexity and\nexecution risk. We expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into supplier\nand capacity arrangements. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional\nVisualization, and Gaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners\n\n25\n\n\freducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. In\naddition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing\ntesting. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay further production of our architecture. While we\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, thirdparty large language models, and generative AI models. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services\ndirectly and through our network of partners, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI\nmodels, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services\ncan be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use\ncases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand\nfor Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Global Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced license requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional\nlicensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the\nMiddle East. We have sold alternative products in China not subject to the license requirements, such as our A800 or H800 offerings. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions, if adopted, would have an\nimmediate material impact on our financial results. However, over the long term, our results and competitive position may be harmed, and we\nmay be effectively excluded from all or part of the China market if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls, if customers in China\ndo not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own\ninternal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant\ntransition costs. While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including\nChina, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, new export controls or changes to existing export controls could negatively impact our business. Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global\neconomic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations. While difficult to isolate and quantify,\nthese macroeconomic factors can impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of\nour investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply\nchain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors. 26\n\n\fSecond Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Summary\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 30, 2023\nRevenue\nGross margin\nOperating expenses\nOperating income\nNet income\nNet income per diluted share\n\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n\nApril 30, 2023\n\nJuly 31, 2022\n\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n13,507\n$\n7,192\n$\n6,704\n70.1 %\n64.6 %\n43.5 %\n2,662\n$\n2,508\n$\n2,416\n6,800\n$\n2,140\n$\n499\n6,188\n$\n2,043\n$\n656\n2.48\n$\n0.82\n$\n0.26\n\nQuarter-over-Quarter\nChange\n88 %\n5.5 pts\n6%\n218 %\n203 %\n202 %\n\nYear-over-Year\nChange\n101 %\n26.6 pts\n10 %\n1,263 %\n843 %\n854 %\n\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where\nour expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $13.51 billion, up 101% from a year ago and up 88% sequentially. Data Center revenue was up 171% from a year ago and up 141% sequentially, led by CSPs and large consumer internet companies. Strong\ndemand for the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper and Ampere GPU architectures was primarily driven by the development of large\nlanguage models and generative AI. Data Center Compute grew 195% from a year ago and 157% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp\nof our Hopper-based HGX platform. Networking was up 94% from a year ago and up 85% sequentially, primarily on strong growth in InfiniBand\ninfrastructure to support our HGX platform. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, CSPs represented slightly more than half of our estimated\nData Center end demand, with large consumer internet companies being the next largest end demand, followed by enterprise and high\nperformance computing. Gaming revenue was up 22% from a year ago and up 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs\nbased on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture following normalization of channel inventory levels. Professional Visualization revenue was down 24% from a year ago and up 28% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower\nsell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise\nworkstation demand and the ramp of NVIDIA RTX products based on the Ada Lovelace Architecture. Automotive revenue was up 15% from a year ago and down 15% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by sales of selfdriving platforms. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower overall auto demand, particularly in China. Gross margin increased from a year ago and sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in Data Center sales. The year-on-year increase also\nreflects the impact on the year-ago gross margin from $1.34 billion in inventory provisions and related charges. Operating expenses were up 10% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based\ncompensation, reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases. Market Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $10.32 billion, up 171% from a year ago. We announced that the NVIDIA\nGH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is available in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; announced the NVIDIA L40S GPU - a universal data center\nprocessor for compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inference, is available now; unveiled the NVIDIA MGX server reference\ndesign; announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI; and partnered with a\n\n27\n\n\frange of companies on AI initiatives, including ServiceNow, Accenture, VMware, Snowflake, WPP, SoftBank, and Hugging Face.

Compute GPUs grew 208% year-on-year and 112% compared to the first half\nof fiscal year 2023 led by demand for NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper and Ampere GPU architecture for large language models and\ngenerative AI. Networking was up 94% year-on-year and 63% compared to the first half of last year driven primarily by strong growth in\nInfiniBand infrastructure to support our HGX platform. Graphics - The increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 primarily reflects growth in\nGaming GPUs related to the demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture following\nnormalization of channel inventory levels. The decrease in the first half of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2023 primarily\nreflects 16% lower Gaming GPU sales and 36% lower Professional Visualization GPU sales, due to lower sell-in to partners following\nnormalization of channel inventory levels. Concentration of Revenue\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in\na different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second\nquarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and 70% and 74% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2023,\nrespectively. The increase in revenue to the United States for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to higher\nU.S.-based Data Center end demand. Our customer and partner network incorporates original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system builders, system\nintegrators, add-in board manufacturers, retailers/distributors, independent software vendors, internet and CSPs, automotive manufacturers and\ntier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants. One data center distributor customer represented\napproximately 17% and 13% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and was attributable to the\nCompute & Networking segment. There were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year\n2023. A large CSP, which primarily purchases indirectly through multiple system integrators and distributors, is estimated to represent approximately\n22% and 19% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and was attributable to our Compute &\nNetworking segment. Our estimated Compute & Networking end customer demand is concentrated among several large CSPs and consumer\ninternet companies. Most of these large companies do not purchase directly from us but often purchase through multiple system integrators,\ndistributors, and channel partners. We expect this concentration trend will continue. Gross Margin\nOur overall gross margin increased to 70.1% and 68.2% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively, from 43.5% and\n55.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2023, respectively. The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024\ncompared to second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to higher revenue from Compute GPUs of 208% and 112%,\nrespectively, and lower inventory provisions.", "vector": [[0.016878987, -0.00336024, -0.054861847, 0.010641778, 0.013646676, 0.016482983, 0.0013172243, 0.008421493, -0.044414055, 0.0048266086,
