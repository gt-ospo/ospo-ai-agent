Q3 2022\nresults were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment that continues to deteriorate, with slowing consumer demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, that we\nbelieve impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. CCG revenue was down on lower Notebook volume in the consumer and education\nmarket segments, though Notebook ASPs were higher due to a resulting change in product mix. DCAI Server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers\ntempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of revenue from hyperscale customers within a\ncompetitive environment. NEX revenue increased primarily due to increased demand for 5G products, higher Ethernet demand and ASPs, and accelerated demand for Edge products,\npartially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon.

Lower gross margin from lower\nrevenue, higher unit cost, higher\ninventory reserves, and higher\nperiod charges from ramp of Intel 4\nand Intel 7. Lower EPS from lower gross\nmargin, higher operating expenses\nfrom additional investment in R&D\nand higher losses on equity\ninvestments, partially offset by a\ntax benefit on the operating loss. Lower operating cash flow driven by\nlower income after adjusting for\nnon-cash items, including the gain\non the sale of McAfee and the pretax gain from the divestiture of our\nNAND business; also affected by\nunfavorable working capital\nchanges. Key Developments\n\u25aa\n\u25aa\n\nWe began high-volume manufacturing of Sapphire Rapids, Raptor Lake, and Ponte Vecchio and expect to begin shipping to customers in Q4 2022. We introduced the Intel\u00ae Data Center GPU Flex Series for the intelligent visual cloud, which provides a GPU solution built to flexibly handle a wide range of workloads and helps\nlower and optimize the total cost of ownership for diverse cloud workloads. We also announced the 12th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 SoC processors for IoT Edge, a new lineup of purposebuilt edge products optimized for IoT applications, and we revealed the 13th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 processor family with six new unlocked desktop processors with up to 24 cores and\n32 threads and clock speeds up to 5.8 GHz for leading gaming, streaming and recording experiences. \u25aa\n\nWe announced the Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP), a program which introduces a new funding model to the capital-intensive semiconductor industry. As part of this\nprogram, we signed a definitive agreement with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield). SCIP is an element of our Smart Capital approach, which aims to provide innovative\nways to fund growth and accelerate our IDM 2.0 strategy. This arrangement represents an equity partnership whereby we and Brookfield will own 51% and 49%, respectively, of\nwhat will be a newly-formed entity, Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), which we will fully consolidate into our consolidated financial statements. We expect Arizona Fab will spend up to\n$30.0 billion of investments in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at our Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona where we will be the sole operator of the two new chip factories,\nwhich will support long-term demand for our products and provide capacity for IFS customers. The definitive agreement includes provisions that require us to utilize these two new\nchip factories at specified minimum levels or be subject to penalties. \u25aa\n\nWe expect Mobileye to receive net proceeds of approximately $0.9 billion from completing their IPO and concurrent private placement in Q4 2022. At closing, we expect to own\nroughly 94% of their common stock and to continue to consolidate their results. 1 See\n2 See\n\n\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A. \"Key Terms\" within
