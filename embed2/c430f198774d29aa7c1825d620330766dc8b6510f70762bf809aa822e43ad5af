However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain\nrevenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the\nsegments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged,\nprices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative\nrevenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from\nwhich multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These\nallocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling,\nshared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and\ncircumstances of the costs being allocated.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim\nfinancial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated\nJuly 28, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set\nforth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the\nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of\napplying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less\nin scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an\nopinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nOctober 25, 2022\n\n29\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nITEM 2.
