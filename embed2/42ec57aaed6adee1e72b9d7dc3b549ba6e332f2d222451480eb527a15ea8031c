We have accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to\nlitigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding the VLSI claims, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the\naggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations\nare subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary\ndamages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive\nrelief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in\nparticular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and\ncustomers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Unless specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal\nproceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n19\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nEuropean Commission Competition Matter\nIn 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered\nArticle 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged \u201cconditional rebates and payments\u201d\nthat required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged \u201cpayments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\u201d The EC\nordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a \u20ac1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009. We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in\nits entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC\u2019s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February\n2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court\u2019s January\n2022 decision did not annul the EC\u2019s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrative\nprocedure to determine a fine against us based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding we are unable to make a reasonable\nestimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately \u20ac593 million in default interest, which\napplications have been stayed pending the EC\u2019s appeal of the General Court\u2019s January 2022 decision. Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as \u201cSpectre\u201d and \u201cMeltdown,\u201d\nthat affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the\nindustry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities\nwas publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against us relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of July 26,\n2023, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our\nproducts, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory\nclaims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District\nCourt for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision\nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a\nstay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in\nJune 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted\nseeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture\nand the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the\nlikelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are\nunable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement\nMultiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020\nannouncement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they\ngenerally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court\ngranted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. Given the procedural posture and the nature\nof the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the\nultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or\nrange of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n20\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nLitigation Related to Patent and IP Claims\nWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and\ntechnologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing\nproducts or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to\nindemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages,\naccept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business. VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel\nIn October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and\nprocessor products infringe eight patents that VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). Four patents remain at issue in the case, and VLSI estimates its damages to\nbe approximately $860 million, and seeks enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. We filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent\nTrial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the PTAB\u2019s review. The PTAB subsequently\nfound all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district court lifted the stay in September 2021, and scheduled trial for March 2024\non the claims that were found patentable by the PTAB. In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight\nadditional patents it had acquired from NXP:\n\u25aa The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another\npatent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in prejudgment and post-judgment interest. We have appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including its claim to have a license from Fortress Investment\nGroup\u2019s acquisition of Finjan. In December 2021 and January 2022 the PTAB instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and\nJune 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI may appeal the PTAB\u2019s decisions. \u25aa The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged\ninfringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment. \u25aa The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately\n$949 million in damages, plus a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of\nlaw notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People\u2019s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu)\nCo., Ltd. VLSI asserts one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property\nAdministration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. CNIPA has not yet issued a decision. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and stated that\nfurther trial proceedings were needed but would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants\u2019 invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. VLSI seeks an injunction as well as RMB 1.3\nmillion in costs and expenses, but no damages. In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.\nasserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an\ninjunction. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, but has yet to issue its final decision. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. We have accrued a charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI\u2019s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are\nunable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.
