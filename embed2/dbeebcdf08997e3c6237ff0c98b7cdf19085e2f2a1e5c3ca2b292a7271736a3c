The venue for any litigation\nrelated to this Award Agreement will be in King County, Washington. Awardee and the Company agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy relating to this Award Agreement between each other,\nincluding claims against the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, and the current and former officers, directors, or employees of any of them (collectively\n\u201cthe Company\u201d), in the manner specified in this Section 19. The Company and its affiliates, and Awardee, are referred to below as \u201cparties.\u201d\nThe parties agree to first attempt to resolve all disputes through informal negotiations. The party asserting the dispute shall provide written\nnotice to the other party describing with specificity the nature of the dispute. Written notice to Awardee shall be delivered to Awardee\u2019s home\naddress appearing in the Company\u2019s records. Written notice to the Company shall be delivered to the attention of its General Counsel. Within five days after delivery of the written notice, the other party shall respond in writing stating its position. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve all disputes by binding arbitration\nbefore a single qualified mutually selected arbitrator in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the\nAmerican Arbitration Association. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, each party shall select a representative and those two\nrepresentatives shall select a qualified arbitrator who shall preside over the arbitral proceeding. The party initiating the arbitration normally\nshall bear the burden of proof and normally must prove any actual damages sought, but these proof issues will be determined by applicable\nlaw. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the extent consistent with applicable law. The Company\nshall pay the arbitration costs, including the administrative fees and the arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses. The arbitrator shall issue a written\ndecision within fifteen days of the end of the hearing.

The arbitration itself, and all testimony, documents, briefs and arguments therein,\nshall be kept confidential. This Section 19 shall survive the employer-employee relationship between the Company and Awardee. 20. Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Award Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the\nvalidity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable provisions shall be deemed null and void; however, to the extent permissible by law, any provisions that could be deemed null\nand void shall first be construed, interpreted or revised retroactively to permit this Award Agreement to be construed so as to foster the intent\nof this Award Agreement and the Plan. 21.
