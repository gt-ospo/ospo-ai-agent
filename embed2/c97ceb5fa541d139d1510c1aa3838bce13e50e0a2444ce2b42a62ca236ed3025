Our YTD 2023 revenue was $24.7 billion, down $9.0 billion or 27% from YTD 2022. CCG\nrevenue decreased 12% from Q2 2022 and 26% from YTD 2022 due primarily to lower notebook and desktop volumes on lower demand and from customers tempering\npurchases to reduce existing inventories. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the relative strength in the education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products\ncombined with a higher mix of older generation products, while desktop ASPs increased due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market\nsegments. DCAI revenue decreased 15% from Q2 2022 and decreased 28% from YTD 2022 due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market,\npartially offset by higher server ASPs from an increased mix of high core count products and an increase in revenue from the FPGA product line. NEX revenue decreased 38%\nfrom Q2 2022 and decreased 34% from YTD 2022 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product\nlines. We expect our net revenue to improve sequentially throughout 2023 with higher net revenue in the second half of the year, which generally aligns to the historical seasonality\ntrends that we typically experience for our business. MD&A\n\n31\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nGross Margin\nWe derived substantially all of our overall gross margin in Q2 2023, and most of our gross margin in YTD 2023, from the sale of products in the CCG and DCAI operating\nsegments. Our overall gross margin dollars in Q2 2023 decreased by $949 million, or 17% compared to Q2 2022, and YTD 2023 decreased by $6.2 billion, or 42% compared to\nYTD 2022.

When compared to the estimated useful\nlife in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by $4.2 billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.5 billion\nincrease to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and a $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This estimate is based on the assets in use and\nunder construction as of the beginning of 2023 and is calculated at that point in time. Because most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is\nincluded in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which\nsuch costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is\nincluded in our 2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.", "vector":
