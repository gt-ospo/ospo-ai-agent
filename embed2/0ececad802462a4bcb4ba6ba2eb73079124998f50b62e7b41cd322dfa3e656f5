In October 2022, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. We dispute the\nallegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

We evaluate, on a regular\n\n14\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nbasis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous\naccruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we\ndisclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to\nestimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such\nmatters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which\ncould have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 14.0 years as of September 30, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified\nredemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $53.3 billion and\n$53.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $1.0 billion to\n$1.5 billion in August 2022 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is\navailable until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the\nundrawn portion. There were $803 million and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and September 30,\n2022, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.7%. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, we have pledged $918 million and $1.2 billion\nof our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2\ninputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the \u201cCommercial Paper Programs\u201d) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured\ncommercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to \u20ac3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed\n397 days from the date of issue. In March 2022, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $10.0 billion to $20.0 billion. There were $725\nmillion and $11.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, which were\nincluded in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of\n0.08% and 2.54%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. 15\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nWe also have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which was amended and restated in\nMarch 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion and to extend the term to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three\nadditional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable\nbenchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $318 million and $1.1 billion of borrowings outstanding under\nthese facilities as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. In\naddition, we had $10.0 billion of unused letters of credit as of September 30, 2022. Note 6 \u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nStock Repurchase Activity\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration, which\nreplaced the previous $5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of\nour common stock for $6.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 under these programs. As of September 30, 2022, we have $6.1 billion\nremaining under the repurchase program. Stock Award Activity\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.5 billion and 10.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and\nSeptember 30, 2022. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the\napplicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,\nchanges in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be\nmore or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax\nrate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our\nability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. For 2022, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the U.S. federal research and development credit. In addition, valuation\ngains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and may cause variability in our effective tax rate. 17\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOur income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $4.2 billion, which included $1.7 billion of net discrete tax benefits\nprimarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and audit-related developments. Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity\ninvestment in Rivian. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $750 million and $742 million in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, tax contingencies were approximately $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and\nuncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income\ntax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019\ntax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These\nexaminations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination\nas well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the\nUnited Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular\njurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and\ncharacterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg Tax Authority (\u201cLTA\u201d) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the\nU.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA\u2019s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.", "vector": [[0.031988107, 0.014681071, -0.15743624, 0.005260881, 0.04345516, 0.050532084,
