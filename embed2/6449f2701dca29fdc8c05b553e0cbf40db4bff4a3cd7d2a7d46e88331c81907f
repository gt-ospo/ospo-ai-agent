{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 INTC.txt", "chunk_index": 9, "chunk_text": "In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required\nour customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival\nproducts.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of \u20ac1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately\nbring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision. We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its\nentirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of\nIntel\u2019s grounds of appeal. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to\nexamine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n19\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nThe General Court appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC\u2019s 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice\u2019s clarifications of the law, and in January 2022, the\nGeneral Court issued a decision annulling the EC's findings against Intel regarding rebates as well as the fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to Intel in February 2022. In April\n2022, the EC appealed the General Court's decision to the Court of Justice, seeking an order that would require a further proceeding and decision by the General Court. In June 2022,\nIntel filed a response in opposition to the EC appeal, and in July 2022, the Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed a response in opposition to the EC appeal. Given the\nprocedural posture and the nature of this proceeding we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. In a related matter, Intel filed applications with the General Court in April 2022 seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately \u20ac593 million in default interest. Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as \u201cSpectre\u201d and \u201cMeltdown,\u201d that affect\nmany types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the\nresearch and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 2, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported,\nbefore software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of October 26,\n2022, consumer class action lawsuits against Intel were pending in the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of\npurchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law\nand statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs' failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have\nappealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of\nOntario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect until November 2022. In Israel, the plaintiff in a lawsuit pending in the District Court of\nHaifa advised the court in September 2022 that it intends to seek leave in October 2022 to withdraw its motion for class certification and voluntarily dismiss the action. In Argentina, Intel\nArgentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending\nproceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of\nany class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of\nlosses, if any, that might arise from those matters. VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel\nIn October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement of eight patents acquired\nfrom NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP B.V., are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303;\n8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be at least $5.5 billion, and its\ncomplaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, Intel filed Inter Partes Review (IPR)\npetitions challenging the patentability of claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted review of six patents and denied institution on two\npatents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 2019.", "vector": [[0.120531544, 0.09811341, -0.1566778, 0.026279284, 0.00017153457,
