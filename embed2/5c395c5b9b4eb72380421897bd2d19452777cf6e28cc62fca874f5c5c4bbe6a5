Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. Our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry\nstandards. Our success depends on our ability to:\n\u2022\n\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that\nmeet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological\ninnovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies;\n\n\u2022\n\ndevelop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\n\n\u2022\n\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including software, services and cloud solutions, as well as software-, infrastructure-, or\nplatform-as-a-service solutions;\n\n\u2022\n\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\n\n\u2022\n\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards;\n\n\u2022\n\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\n\n\u2022\n\ndevelop, acquire, and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including acquisition integrations,\ncustomer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and\n\n\u2022\n\ncomplete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities. We have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful\nrevenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and\nprovide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent\nus from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will\nprovide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which includes\ncloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable\npretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host these software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue\nto enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and\navailability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone\nsoftware\n\n35\n\n\fsolutions including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other software solutions. These new business models\nor strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and\nmay not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a\nquarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant\nmismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our\nmarket platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\nbusiness needs or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be\nimpeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our\nplatform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead\ntimes on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums\nand provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not\nhave the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand\nfor our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\nincluding:\n\u2022\n\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n\n\u2022\n\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\n\n\u2022\n\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\n\u2022\n\ntime to market;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\n\n\u2022\n\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\n\u2022\n\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and\ngenerative AI models; or\n\n\u2022\n\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage. Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last two quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. In\norder to meet this demand, we have increased our purchase obligations\n\n36\n\n\fwith existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes and\nnumber of suppliers may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect our supply to increase each quarter through next\nyear. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity arrangements. We may incur inventory provisions or\nimpairments if our inventory or supply and capacity commitments are impacted by changes in demand for our products. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product\ntransitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming\nproducts may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product\ntransitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or\nvolatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when\ncustomers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture\ntransitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and quality concerns not identified in\nmanufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay further production of our\narchitecture. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these\ntransitions are difficult, and we may incur additional costs. We sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made\nby our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products\nhave impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates\nprovided by various downstream parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience\nsupply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at\nall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,\nsince some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one\ncomponent have had and may have a broader revenue impact. If we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of noncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and\nprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively\nimpact our gross margins and financial results. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services, our\nOmniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and\nservices can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these\nuse cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased\ndemand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is\n\n37\n\n\funknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree\nof precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we expect to start shipping our CPU\nproduct offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our\nCPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical\ntensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and\ncan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years\nago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government\ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has\nimpacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand\nfor our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have\nreduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously\nintroduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address\ndemand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace GPU architectures no\nlonger include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which\nalso makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution\nchannels. Additionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications\nthat leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as\nGeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our\nplatforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our\ncustomers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand. Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our\ncontrol over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test\nor package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in\nour systems, boards, and products. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer\ndemand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business\noperations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\u2022\n\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from\nincorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n\n\u2022\n\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test\ncapacity for our products;\n\n38\n\n\f\u2022\n\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller\ngeometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our\nproducts;\n\n\u2022\n\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and\nmemory manufacturers;\n\n\u2022\n\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and\ncommencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;\n\n\u2022\n\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\n\n\u2022\n\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\n\n\u2022\n\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or\nfoundries prioritize our competitors\u2019 or other customers\u2019 orders over ours;\n\n\u2022\n\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;\n\n\u2022\n\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry\u2019s proprietary process technology; and\n\n\u2022\n\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves or other natural disasters and\nelectricity conservation efforts. International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are\nmanufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 55% and 59% of our\nrevenue during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States, respectively. The global nature of our\nbusiness subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and political conditions between\ncountries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health\nissues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic and international business and cultural\npractices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations, and natural disasters, acts of war or\nother military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events. Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military\nactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located\nin California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and\ndevelopment systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase\neconomic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries\nin which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts,\nincluding but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of\nour products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory\n\n39\n\n\frequirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring,\nand profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where\nwe have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our\noperations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including\nnatural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic,\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being\nlocated and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party\nsystems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and\nsubstantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future\nsales and operating results. Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including\ndue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and\nservices and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service\ninterruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the\nability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services. We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help\nexpand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our\nability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we\npursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If\nwe are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition\nless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived\nability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold\ninvestments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In\naddition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key\nbusiness initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which\nwe invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any\nof the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.", "vector": [[0.03908705, -0.013686867,
