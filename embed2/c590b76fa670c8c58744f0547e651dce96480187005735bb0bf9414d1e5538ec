Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\u201cForm 10-Q\u201d) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding\nthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d\n\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Form 10-K\u201d) under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or\nperiods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the\n\u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance\nmatters, and details related to the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not\nincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction. Fiscal Period\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years\n2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Quarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies\nrelative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of\niPad. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro\u00ae powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K. The Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15\n\n\fCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition. Certain of the Company\u2019s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced, and could in the future experience,\ndisruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the\nCompany\u2019s primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at significantly reduced capacity,\nimpacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments. Macroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company\u2019s business. The\nCompany believes these factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Segment Operating Performance\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\nCompany\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic\nregion. Further information regarding the Company\u2019s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data.\u201d\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\n\nNet sales by reportable segment:\nAmericas\nEurope\nGreater China\nJapan\nRest of Asia Pacific\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n$\n\n49,278\n27,681\n23,905\n6,755\n9,535\n117,154\n\nDecember 25,\n2021\n\n$\n\n$\n\n51,496\n29,749\n25,783\n7,107\n9,810\n123,945\n\nChange\n\n(4)%\n(7)%\n(7)%\n(5)%\n(3)%\n(5)%\n\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially\noffset by higher net sales of Services and iPad.
