{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 35, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt:Cash from financing increased $25.6 billion to $14.8 billion for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a $25.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments. Cash\nfrom investing increased $3.6 billion to $503 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to an $8.2 billion increase in\ncash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $3.6 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and\nequipment. Debt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The proceeds of these\nissuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital\nexpenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 9 \u2013 Debt of the Notes to Financial\nStatements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (\u201cSA\u201d)\nand cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and\nrecognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in\nadvance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. 38\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2023:\n(In millions)\nThree Months Ending\n\nDecember 31, 2023\nMarch 31, 2024\nJune 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2024\nThereafter\nTotal\n\n$\n\n21,006\n14,860\n8,551\n2,012\n2,759\n\n$\n\n49,188\n\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and\nservices, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription\nperiod or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 11 \u2013 Unearned Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q) for further discussion. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in\nyear six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As of September 30, 2023, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $7.7 billion, of\nwhich $3.7 billion is short-term and payable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Share Repurchases\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 11 million shares and 17 million shares of our common stock for\n$3.6 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, $18.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 14 \u2013 Stockholders\u2019 Equity of the Notes\nto Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion. Dividends\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.75 per share and $0.68\nper share, totaling $5.6 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends,\nsubject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 14 \u2013 Stockholders\u2019 Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of\nthis Form 10-Q) for further discussion. Other Planned Uses of Capital\nOn October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. for a cash payment of $61.8 billion, net of cash acquired. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as\nacquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and\ncomputer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to\nincrease in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance\nleases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have\nnot engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 39\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and\nexpenses.", "vector":
