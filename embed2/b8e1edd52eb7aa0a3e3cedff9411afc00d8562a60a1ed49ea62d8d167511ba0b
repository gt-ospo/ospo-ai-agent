{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 AMZN.txt:Our investment in Rivian\u2019s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to\nRivian\u2019s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2023,\nwe held 158 million shares of Rivian\u2019s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17% ownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the\npurchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on\n\n8\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nRivian\u2019s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on our\nconsolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. The investment was subject\nto regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1\n2022. Required summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2022\n\nRevenues\n\n$\n\n2023\n\n459\n\n$\n\n1,782\n\nGross profit\n\n(1,206)\n\n(947)\n\nLoss from operations\n\n(3,287)\n\n(2,718)\n\nNet loss\n\n(3,305)\n\n(2,544)\n\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost\nand net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The\ninventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\nIncluded in \u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers,\nas well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, customer receivables, net, were $26.6 billion and\n$28.1 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion and $6.3 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, and other receivables, net,\nwere $3.1 billion and $2.5 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers\nprimarily to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was\n$1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. Digital Video and Music Content\nThe total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 were $16.7 billion\nand $18.0 billion. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.6 years. Total video and music expense was $4.2 billion and $4.6\nbillion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $11.4 billion and $13.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service\nperiod. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31,\n2022 was $16.1 billion, of which $10.9 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in \u201cOther long-term\nliabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that\nhave not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet\nrecognized were $133.0 billion as of September 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.5 years. However, the amount\nand timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. 9\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nAcquisition Activity\nOn February 22, 2023, we acquired 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cOne Medical\u201d), for cash consideration of approximately $3.5 billion, net of cash acquired, to\nprovide health care options for customers. The acquired assets primarily consist of $1.3 billion of intangible assets and $2.5 billion of goodwill, which is\nallocated to our North America segment. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the One Medical acquisition were not material to our consolidated results\nof operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt,\nsubject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand. Note 2 \u2014 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash,\nAAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash\nequivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following\nhierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1\u2014Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.", "vector": [[0.06196861, 0.0646494, -0.14865501, -0.048312776, 0.011411546, -0.013707904, 0.04884135, -0.027930439, 0.05158359,
