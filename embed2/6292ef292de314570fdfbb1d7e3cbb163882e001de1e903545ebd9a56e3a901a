{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 22, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt:We face\nadditional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management\u2019s\nattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the\nassets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring. Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\n\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,\nincluding key personnel, of the acquired business;\n\n\u2022\n\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n\n40\n\n\f\u2022\n\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\n\u2022\n\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\n\u2022\n\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\nunable to close an acquisition;\n\n\u2022\n\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\ncovenants or other restrictions;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n\n\u2022\n\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n\n\u2022\n\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n\n\u2022\n\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target\u2019s employees, vendors and customers. For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\npersonnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\nsales to end customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these end\ncustomers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. For example,\none data center distributor customer represented approximately 17% and 13% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year\n2024, respectively. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our\noperating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our\nprocessors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter\ntheir purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally\ncancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their\nown solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the\nmarkets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. A large CSP, which primarily\npurchases indirectly through multiple system integrators and distributors, is estimated to represent approximately 22% and 19% of total revenue\nfor the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and was attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated\nCompute & Networking end customer demand is concentrated among several large CSPs and consumer internet companies. Most of these\nlarge companies do not purchase directly from us but often purchase through multiple system integrators, distributors, and channel partners. We\nexpect this concentration trend will continue. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter\nend, the system builders and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our\nrevenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or\nother countries\u2019 trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of\noperations. Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\nactions may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and\n\n41\n\n\ftariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental,\nhealth, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such\nrequirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and\nability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations\ncould result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to\nour reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could\nlead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and\noperate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation,\nregulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity\nresulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their\ninterpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,\nrestrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact\nthe timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate\ncould negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,\ndecrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material\nadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.\nlaws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control\nmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year\n2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer\nsales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future. The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products\nand services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and\nservice offerings. Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI\napplications, models, and solutions, could result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, refining, and\ndeploying large language models. Such restrictions could limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and\nuse systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.", "vector": [[0.03269454, 0.10036687, -0.12303493, 0.029148731, 0.05167467, 0.042378657, 0.0046022725, -0.00220452, 0.074588366, 0.020795207, -0.023305451, 0.028980795,
