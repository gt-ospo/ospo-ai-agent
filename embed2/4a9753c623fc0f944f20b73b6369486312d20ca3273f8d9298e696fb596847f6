The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the comparable\nprior year period, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view\nthese offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. 27\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a\ndecrease in payroll and related expenses. The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\ncompared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $165 million and $244 million for Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $504 million and $613 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network\nfacilities and physical store closures in 2023, and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense\nOur interest income was $277 million and $776 million during Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $544 million and $2.0 billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and\ninvestment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on\nthe prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $617 million and $806 million during Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 3 \u2014 Leases and Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d\nfor additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was $759 million and $1.0 billion during Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $(13.4) billion and $649 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2022 and 2023. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity\nwarrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.1 billion and $1.2\nbillion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $(10.4) billion and $926 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in\nRivian. Income Taxes\nOur income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily\nattributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1\nbillion, which included $175 million of net discrete tax expense. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Income Taxes\u201d for additional\ninformation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain\nnon-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet\nthe definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property\nand equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.", "vector": [[0.05025888, 0.05959156, -0.16448376, -0.04345537, -0.00093802286, 0.016171949, 0.048824277, -0.030546462, 0.038613316, 0.0006177534, -0.05597744, 0.0037838384,
