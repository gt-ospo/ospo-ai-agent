(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable\nterms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with\nrenewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated\ntiming and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. (4) Excludes approximately $5.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of\npayment, if any. 13\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOther Contingencies\nWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as\nsales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax\ncontroversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on\ntransactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the\ninherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such\ncontroversies may be materially different from our expectations. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial\nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in\nItem 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the\nperiods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, as supplemented by the following:\nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (\u201cN.D. Ill.\u201d), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, including Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other\nthings, that Amazon\u2019s collection, storage, use, retention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The\ncomplaints allege purported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including Amazon\nPhotos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon\u2019s Flex driver app, and Amazon\u2019s virtual try-on technology. The complaints seek\ncertification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing\nand intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington\n(\u201cW.D. Wash.\u201d), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between\nAmazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust\nenrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court\nof the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of\nseveral distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by\nAmazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief,\ncivil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September\n2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things,\nthat Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive\npractices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks\ninjunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. Amazon\u2019s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in FrameWilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in March\n2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s\npricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in its entirety; the\ndismissal is under appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other\nintellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes,\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to\nour operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that\ncould affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and\nchanges to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such\nan estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been\nincorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the\n\n14\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\namounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 12.9 years as of September 30, 2023. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified\nredemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $61.4 billion and\n$56.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), which matures in January\n2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan\u2019s\nmaturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75% to 1.05%. As of September 30, 2023, $5.0 billion of the Term Loan was outstanding,\nwhich was included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had an interest rate of 6.2%. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we may from time to time\nincrease in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $972 million of\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, we have pledged $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related\nto our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31,\n2022 and September 30, 2023. We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the \u201cCommercial Paper Programs\u201d) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured\ncommercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to \u20ac3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed\n397 days from the date of issue. There were $6.8 billion and $567 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weightedaverage effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for\ngeneral corporate purposes. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), with a term that extends to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The\n\n15\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\ninterest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%,\nwith a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cShort-Term Credit Agreement\u201d), which matures in\nNovember 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances\nunder the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a\ncommitment fee of 0.05% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022\nand September 30, 2023. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $1.2 billion and $166 million of borrowings outstanding under\nthese facilities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. In\naddition, we had $7.8 billion of unused letters of credit as of September 30, 2023. Note 6 \u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nStock Repurchase Activity\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration, which\nreplaced the previous $5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of\nour common stock for $6.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of our common stock\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program. Stock Award Activity\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and\nSeptember 30, 2023.

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the\napplicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,\nchanges in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be\nmore or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax\nrate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our\nability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. 17\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nFor 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development\ncredit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and\nmay cause variability in our effective tax rate. Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily\nattributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1\nbillion, which included $175 million of net discrete tax expense, primarily consisting of discrete tax expense related to shortfalls from stock-based\ncompensation and approximately $600 million of tax benefit resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S.\nfederal R&D credit. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $742 million and $2.6 billion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $4.3 billion and $7.0 billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, tax contingencies were approximately $4.0 billion and $5.0 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and\nuncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income\ntax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019\ntax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These\nexaminations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination\nas well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the\nUnited Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular\njurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and\ncharacterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (\u201cLTA\u201d) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the\nU.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA\u2019s position is without merit, we intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. The Indian tax authority (\u201cITA\u201d) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this\nmatter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA\u2019s position is without merit, we are defending our position\nvigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense,\nincluding for taxes previously paid.", "vector": [[0.031035641, 0.009581737, -0.06412655, -0.042519044,
