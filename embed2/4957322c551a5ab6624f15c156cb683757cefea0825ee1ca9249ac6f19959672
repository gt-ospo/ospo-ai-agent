{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 9, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 AMZN.txt:Based on\nthat decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006\nthrough June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an\ninitial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission\u2019s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending\nconclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the\nEuropean Union General Court annulled the European Commission\u2019s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the\nEuropean Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Note 8 \u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses\n\u201cFulfillment,\u201d \u201cTechnology and infrastructure,\u201d \u201cSales and marketing,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the\nsegment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in \u201cTechnology and infrastructure\u201d are incurred in the U.S. and are included\nin our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in \u201cTechnology and infrastructure\u201d are allocated to the AWS\n\n18\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nsegment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating\ndecision maker evaluates the Company\u2019s business performance and manages its operations. North America\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and\nsubscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and\nsubscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores\n(including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused\nonline stores. AWS\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government\nagencies, and academic institutions.
