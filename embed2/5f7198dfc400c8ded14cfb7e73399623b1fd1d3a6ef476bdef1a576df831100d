{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 AAPL.txt", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_text": "In the event of a formation of a new\nparent company by a Comparison Group member, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after\nthe transaction of the equity interests in the original Comparison Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparison\nGroup member immediately prior to the transaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group\nmember to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a\nnational securities exchange but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original Comparison Group member are\nnot. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two Comparison Group members (including, without limitation, the\nacquisition of one Comparison Group member, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member),\nthe surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison\nGroup, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities\nexchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable\nstock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives\nof the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction. \u2022\n\n\u201cTSR\u201d shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i)\nthe difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and\nother distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be\nvalued at fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be\ndetermined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution. \u2022\n\n\u201cBeginning Price\u201d means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member, the average of the closing\nmarket prices of such company\u2019s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20)\nconsecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining\nBeginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional\nshares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution. \u2022\n\n\u201cEnding Price\u201d means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member, the average of the closing\nmarket prices of such company\u2019s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20)\nconsecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Ending\nPrice, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of\nstock at the closing market price on the date of distribution. With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustment to\nthe extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or\nreverse stock split occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending\nPrice, as the case may be). In the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be final and binding. A-2\n\n\fExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION\nI, Timothy D. Cook, certify that:\n1.
