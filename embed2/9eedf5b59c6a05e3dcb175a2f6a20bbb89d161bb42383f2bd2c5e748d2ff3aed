It is not clear how existing laws\ngoverning issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection\napply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence\ntechnologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and\nexpanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by\ngovernments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon\u2019s\nU.S. and European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data, fulfillment services, and featured offers, and legislative and regulatory\ninitiatives in Europe and elsewhere allow authorities to restrict or prohibit certain operations or actions pre-emptively without the need to assess specific\ncompetitive effects. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data,\nthe interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. Unfavorable regulations, laws,\ndecisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions\nthreatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including\nsubstantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our\noperations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and\nthreatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide\nrange of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data\nprotection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our\nproducts, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek\nto regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection\nclaims, including those brought by state attorneys general. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption\nof our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are\n\n43\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may\nnot reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the\namount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a\nmaterial effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more\nsuch proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future\npayments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect\non our operations.", "vector": [[0.08192832, 0.054332115,
