{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 19, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q1 NVDA.txt:Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy\navailability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts\nof extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to\nwildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the\nability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential\nto increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause\nus to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of\nproperty, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies\nhave large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by\ninsurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations\nrelating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits, such as proposed SEC rules and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting\nDirective, could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw\nmaterials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and\nenergy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers\nincurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations\nby increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently\nresponsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated\ngoals to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025 and annually thereafter and to engage\nmanufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of our scope 3 category 1 greenhouse gas emissions with the goal of effecting supplier\nadoption of science-based targets aligned with limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of fiscal year 2026, which could harm\nour reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply\nchain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. 38\n\n\fWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by\ndecreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and\noperation, and/or by increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we\nlose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of\nthese distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\nour products, all of which may alter partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. Our estimated Compute & Networking end customer demand is\nconcentrated among a few large cloud service providers and consumer internet companies. Some of these large companies do not purchase\ndirectly from us but often purchase through several system builders and channel partners. We expect this trend will continue. If end demand\nincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system builders and channel partners may have\nlimited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a\nsignificant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries\u2019 trade restrictions, or any difficulties in\ncollecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the\nexpectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional\nfactors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\n\nour ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\n\n\u2022\n\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n\n\u2022\n\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our\nability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;\n\n\u2022\n\nour vendors' payment requirements;\n\n\u2022\n\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards. Any of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted and may\ncontinue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to\ncollect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. In addition, the timing of our operating expenses and\ninvestments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where current profitability may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our\nexpectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or\nexperience substantial price volatility. 39\n\n\fOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\nactions may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business\nacquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\nemployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,\nand may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our\nemployees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have\ndesigned to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we\nare subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further\nrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in\ncorporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the\nimposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have\nan adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in\nthe regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,\ndecrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material\nadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.\nlaws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control\nmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year\n2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer\nsales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future. The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products\nand services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and\nservice offerings. Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI\napplications, models, and solutions, could result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, refining, and\ndeploying large language models. Such restrictions could limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and\nuse systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.", "vector": [[0.0065194354, -0.014160566, -0.116133444, -0.047439296, 0.0174723, 0.070166625, 0.029214753, -0.0061539845, -0.012401332, 0.013756435, 0.03241045,
