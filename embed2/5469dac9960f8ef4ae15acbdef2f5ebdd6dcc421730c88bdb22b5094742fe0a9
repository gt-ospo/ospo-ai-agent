{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 41, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt:We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These\nclaims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI\nservices, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or\nall of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the\nfuture. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable\noutcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government\ncontracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we\nmay be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental\ncontractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some\nagreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may\nbe subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our\nproducts and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations\nwhere the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) and\npossible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in\nour consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance\nevolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our\nresults may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. 54\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax\nestimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to\nincrease tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal\nRevenue Service audit for prior tax years and have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) from the IRS for the tax years 2004\nto 2013. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment\nof $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the\namounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or\nperiods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country\nmay result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to\ncorporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in\ntaxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial\nstatements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating\nresults may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other\nintellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent\nrespect for patent rights. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their\nobligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly\nin certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source\ncode leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products\nby copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could\nincrease the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.", "vector": [[0.04645043, 0.058225326, -0.11170999, -0.0020241295,
