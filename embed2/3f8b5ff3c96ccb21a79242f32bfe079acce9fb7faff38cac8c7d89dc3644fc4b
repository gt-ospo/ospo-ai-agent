We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition,\nimpairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products\nand services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant\njudgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine\nwhether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud\nservice and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency,\nand interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional\ncharge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine\nwhether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using\ninformation that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and\nservices due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information\nsuch as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the\nexercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to\nrecognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information\nbecomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among\nother factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This\ndetermination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available\nquantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse\nconditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than\nnot that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in\nother income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate,\nwe may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the\ninvestment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic\nbasis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is\ndetermined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. 40\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.", "vector": [[0.09135923, 0.028806582, -0.15402612, -0.049018174, 0.046046343, 0.017556986, 0.07141615, -0.0021186986,
