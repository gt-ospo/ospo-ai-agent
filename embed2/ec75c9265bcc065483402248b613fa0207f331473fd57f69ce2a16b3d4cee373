{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 INTC.txt", "chunk_index": 18, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q1 INTC.txt:In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against Intel in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various\nIntel processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP. The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021,\nand the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the\ndoctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162.3\nmillion in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. Intel has appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including its\nclaim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group\u2019s acquisition of Finjan. In December 2021 and January 2022, the PTAB instituted\nIPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, but it has not yet issued a final written decision on either petition. The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought\napproximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final\njudgment following the second trial in Texas. The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining\npatent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment following the third trial in Texas. In February 2023, Intel filed motions for a new trial and for\njudgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People\u2019s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai)\nCo., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an\ninvalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), which held a hearing in\nSeptember 2021. CNIPA has not yet issued a decision. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and stated that further trial\nproceedings were needed but would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants\u2019 invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. VLSI seeks an\ninjunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.,\nand Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in\nDecember 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. The court held a second trial hearing in May\n2022, but has yet to issue its final decision. In December 2022, Intel filed a second petition to invalidate the patent at issue. Intel has accrued a charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI\u2019s claims and intend to\nvigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent\ndevelopments and future proceedings.

We believe CCG, DCAI, and NEX customers, among others, tempered purchases to reduce their existing inventories and adjust to the\nmacroeconomic uncertainty. We expect this macroeconomic uncertainty and the challenging market environment will continue during\n2023. Q1 2023 vs. Q1 2022\nOur Q1 2023 revenue was $11.7 billion, down $6.6 billion or 36% from Q1 2022. CCG revenue decreased 38% from Q1 2022 due to\nlower notebook and desktop volumes on lower demand, while notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core and older\ngeneration products. DCAI revenue decreased 39% from Q1 2022 due to lower server volume resulting from a softening data center\nmarket, partially offset by an increase in revenue from the FPGA product line. NEX revenue decreased 30% from Q1 2022, due to lower\ndemand for Edge, Network Xeon, and Ethernet products. Incentives offered to certain customers to compete in the market, accelerate purchases, and to strategically position our products with\ncustomers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $900 million to our revenue during the first\nquarter of 2023, the impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q2 2023 as included in our Form 8-K dated April 27,\n2023.

We\nestimate this change resulted in an approximate $360 million increase to gross margin, an approximate $100 million decrease in R&D\nexpenses, and an approximate $525 million decrease in ending inventory values in Q1 2023 when compared to what the impact would\nhave been using the estimated useful life in place prior to this change. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by\n$4.1 billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.3 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D\nexpenses, and a $1.4 billion decrease in ending inventory values. Operating Expenses\nTotal R&D and MG&A expenses for Q1 2023 were $5.4 billion, down 11% from Q1 2022. These expenses represent 46.2% of revenue for\nQ1 2023 and 33.3% of revenue for Q1 2022. In support of our strategy, described in our 2022 Form 10-K, we continue to make significant\ninvestments to accelerate our process technology roadmap.

Cash\ngenerated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of\nliquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide\nmanufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and\npotential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of $5.4 billion associated with our\npending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing\nexpansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and\nsuppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These\nactions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash\nflows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of\nour accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the\npace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash\nrequirements. In Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to\ncapital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us\nto create long-term value. In Q1 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering\nfor general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital\nexpenditures. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date by one year to March\n2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources\nof liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which\nwe may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing\nauthorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of April 1, 2023 we had $1.0 billion of commercial paper\nobligations outstanding. As of April 1, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our\ninvestments in debt instruments and financing receivables were in investment-grade securities.

The decrease in cash provided by operations in the first three months of 2023 was primarily driven by our net operating loss in\ncomparison to our net operating income for the first three months of 2022. Investing Activities\nInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from\ndivestitures. Cash used for investing activities was higher in the first three months of 2023 compared to the first three months of 2022, primarily due to\nthe absence of proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business and proceeds for our remaining share of McAfee, both of which\noccurred in the first three months of 2022; as well as higher capital expenditures in the first three months of 2023.",
