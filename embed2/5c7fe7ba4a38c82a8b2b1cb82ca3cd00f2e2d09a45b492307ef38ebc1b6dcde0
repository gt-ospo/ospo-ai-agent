Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements\nreflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. These condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.

However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company\u2019s hedged term debt\u2013 and marketable securities\u2013related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized\nwithin 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nJune 25,\n2022\n\nSeptember 25,\n2021\n\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts\n\n$\n$\n\n76,234\n20,775\n\n$\n$\n\n76,475\n16,875\n\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n$\n\n84,506\n\n$\n\n126,918\n\nThe gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021.

Accounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. The Company\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 36% and 42% of total trade receivables as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers.", "vector": [[0.031988107, 0.014681071, -0.15743624, 0.005260881, 0.04345516, 0.050532084, -0.03551643, 0.022741467, 0.012747084,
