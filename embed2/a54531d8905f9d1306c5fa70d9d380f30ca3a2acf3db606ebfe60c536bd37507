Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements\nreflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. These condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal\nyears 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013\nrelated foreign currency transactions is 19 years. Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\n\n\fThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nApril 1,\n2023\n\nSeptember 24,\n2022\n\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts\n\n$\n$\n\n51,119\n19,375\n\n$\n$\n\n102,670\n20,125\n\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n$\n\n111,696\n\n$\n\n185,381\n\nThe gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 24, 2022\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\n\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\n\nTotal\nFair Value\n\nDerivative assets (1):\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n$\n\n4,317\n\n$\n\n2,819\n\n$\n\n7,136\n\nDerivative liabilities (2):\nForeign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts\n\n$\n$\n\n2,205\n1,367\n\n$\n$\n\n2,547\n\u2014\n\n$\n$\n\n4,752\n1,367\n\n(1)\n\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. (2)\n\nDerivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company\u2019s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective\ncounterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party\nto the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nApril 1,\n2023\n\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\nCurrent and non-current term debt\n\n$\n$\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\n\n14,651 $\n(18,249) $\n\nSeptember 24,\n2022\n\n13,378\n(18,739)\n\n\fAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for\n10%. The Company\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers.", "vector": [[0.028622065, -0.024894003, -0.13500835, -0.010357679, 0.05191983, 0.02516442, -0.031536255, 0.012916948, 0.017301358,
