Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, or AI, high-performance computing,\nand accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development\nagreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; cryptocurrency mining processors, or CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms;\nand NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged\nacross our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. The \u201cAll Other\u201d category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of\nmaking operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related\nand other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs, restructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement\ncosts, contributions, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense\ndirectly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate\ndepreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements.
