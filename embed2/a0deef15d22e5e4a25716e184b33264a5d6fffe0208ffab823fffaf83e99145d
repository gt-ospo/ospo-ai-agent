From October 30, 2023 through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $366 million pursuant to a Rule\n10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share\nrepurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee\ncompensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of October 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:\nOctober 29, 2023\n(In millions)\nDue in one year\nDue in one to five years\nDue in five to ten years\nDue in greater than ten years\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\nNet carrying amount\nLess short-term portion\nTotal long-term portion\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,250\n2,250\n2,750\n3,500\n(44)\n9,706\n(1,249)\n8,457\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 29, 2023, we had not issued any\ncommercial paper. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.10 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $115 million recorded in non-current income\ntax payable as of October 29, 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties\nin individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our\ncontractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. Refer to Item 7,\n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our\noperating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements, respectively. 34\n\n\fClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from\nsourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there have been no\nmaterial changes to the financial market risks described as of January 29, 2023. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there\nhave been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 29, 2023. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of October 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide\nreasonable assurance. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or\nERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial\nrecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes\nthat materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\nNVIDIA have been detected. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our\nlegal proceedings since January 29, 2023. Also refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 29, 2023 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings. 35\n\n\fITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal\nquarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters\nended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results\nof operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or\nthat we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed\nwafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of\ncustomer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and\ndemand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has\nsignificantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\nbusiness needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles\nor enter new lines of business, which may require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain\ncomplexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary\nfor the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to\nsecure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to\nscale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may\nnot have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand\nfor our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\nincluding:\n\u2022\n\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\n\n\u2022\n\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n\n\u2022\n\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\n\n\u2022\n\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\n\n\u2022\n\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\n36\n\n\f\u2022\n\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and\ngenerative AI models; or\n\n\u2022\n\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage. Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To\nmeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our\nsupply chain, may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity\narrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product\ntransitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of\ntransitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data\nCenter product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify\nthe challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products,\ncustomers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product\nintroductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for\ncurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same\ntime for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our\nfinancial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges\nand quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and\ndelay further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our\ntechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original equipment manufacturers, original device\nmanufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple original equipment\nmanufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market\nconditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly\nforecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience\nsupply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at\nall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,\nsince some of our products are part of a\n\n37\n\n\fcomplex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader\nrevenue impact. If we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of noncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and\nprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively\nimpact our gross margins and financial results. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services,\nNVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new\nuse cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate\nsignificant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while\nthey have driven increased demand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be\nused in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\nmodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace\nHopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue\nor supply levels. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical\ntensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and\ncan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years\nago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government\ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has\nimpacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand\nfor our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have\nreduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously\nintroduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided cryptocurrency mining processors, or\nCMP, products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and\nAda Lovelace GPU architectures no longer include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the\nunauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our\nnew products and distribution channels. Additionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications\nthat leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as\nGeForce NOW. Failure by\n\n38\n\n\fdevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party\ncontent providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our\nplatforms, could adversely affect customer demand. International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are\nmanufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 65% and 62% of our\nrevenue during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States, respectively. Due to recent\nUSG licensing requirements, we expect that our sales to China and other affected destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2024. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in\nthe future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international\neconomic and political conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to\ncontrol case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic\nand international business and cultural practices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations,\nand natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events. Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military\nactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located\nin California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and\ndevelopment systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase\neconomic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries\nin which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts,\nincluding but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of\nour products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and\noperating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and\ncompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if\nmanufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power\nshortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is\nunknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business\ncould be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume\noperations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results. We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our\napproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our\nnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted\nemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have\n\n39\n\n\fbeen called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate\nperiod, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any\nsignificant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and\nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business. Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including\ndue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and\nservices and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service\ninterruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the\nability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services. We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help\nexpand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our\nability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we\npursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If\nwe are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition\nless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived\nability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in\npublicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have\ninvested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These\ncompanies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are nonmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in\nwhich we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio may\ncontain industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.", "vector": [[0.012675146,
