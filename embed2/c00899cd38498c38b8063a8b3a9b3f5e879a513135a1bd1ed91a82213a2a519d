(d) In the event of the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service due to the Participant\u2019s death, all unvested RSUs eligible to vest on\nVesting Date(s) subsequent to the Participant\u2019s death shall accelerate and vest immediately, and upon the Participant\u2019s death following the\nParticipant\u2019s Termination of Service due to Disability or Retirement any RSUs that were eligible to vest in full, or pro rata in the case of\nRetirement, will be settled as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant\u2019s death in accordance with Section 7. (e)\nIf any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall\nautomatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date without payment of any consideration by the Company and\nwithout any other action by the Participant or the Participant\u2019s personal representative, as the case may be. 9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, \u201cclawback\u201d or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company\nmay require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n(a) during the period of the Participant\u2019s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the \u201cEmployment\nPeriod\u201d), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense\nunder the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n\n3\n\n\f(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of\nconfidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of\nthe Company or any of its Subsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,\nembezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its\nSubsidiaries. For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant\u2019s\nbehalf, to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding the Participant\u2019s Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan to reconvey, transfer, or otherwise return such Shares and other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company\u2019s exclusive remedy\nwith respect to such matters. 10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company\u2019s stock contemplated by\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of\nthe Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited\npursuant to Section 5(b). 11. Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company or the Participant\u2019s employer\n(\u201cEmployer\u201d) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant\u2019s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that\nthe Company and the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with\nany aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares\nacquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to\nstructure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant\u2019s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any\nparticular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the\nCompany or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one\njurisdiction. Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the\nCompany or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company or the Employer, or their\nrespective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable\nwithholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:\n(a) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term cash incentives, payable to the Participant\nby the Company or the Employer;\n(b)\nwithholding otherwise deliverable Shares and from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid\nupon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c) arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant\u2019s behalf and at the Participant\u2019s\ndirection pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n\n4\n\n\f(d)\n\nwithholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or\n\n(e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by\nApplicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then\nthe Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable,\nby withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method\n(b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of\nmethods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above. The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates,\nincluding maximum rates applicable in the Participant\u2019s jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded\nto the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek\na refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number\nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested\nRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may\nrefuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the\nParticipant\u2019s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 12. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by\nelectronic means or request the Participant\u2019s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive\nall applicable documentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line or voice activated system established and\nmaintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company. 13. Data Privacy. By participating in the Plan, the Participant acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and\ntransfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The Company, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information\nabout the Participant, including the Participant\u2019s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security\nnumber or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs\nor any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant\u2019s\nfavor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan
