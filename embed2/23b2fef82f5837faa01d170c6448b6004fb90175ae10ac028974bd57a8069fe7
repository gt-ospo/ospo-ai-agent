CCG revenue decreased 3% from Q3 2022 primarily due to lower desktop volume driven by\nlower demand across business market segments and lower notebook ASPs due to a higher mix of small core products attributable to relative strength in the education market\ncombined with a higher mix of older generation products. These decreases were partially offset by higher notebook volume as customer inventory levels began to normalize and\nhigher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 10% from Q3 2022 due to lower server\nvolume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of\nhigh core count products. NEX revenue decreased 32% as customers tempered purchases to reduce inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product\nlines. YTD 2023 vs. YTD 2022\nOur YTD 2023 revenue was $38.8 billion, down $10.2 billion or 21% from YTD 2022. CCG revenue decreased 19% from YTD 2022 primarily due to lower notebook and desktop\nvolume due to lower demand and from customers tempering purchases to reduce inventories in the first half of 2023. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the relative strength in\nthe education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation products, and were partially offset by higher\ndesktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 23% from YTD 2022 due to lower server\nvolume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, which was partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a\nhigher mix of high core count products and an increase in revenue from the FPGA product line.

When compared to the estimated useful\nlife in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by $4.2 billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.5 billion\nincrease to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and a $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and\nunder construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Because most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is\nincluded in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which\nsuch costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is\nincluded in our 2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis. Operating Expenses\nTotal R&D and MG&A expenses for Q3 2023 were $5.2 billion, down 14% from Q3 2022, and $16.1 billion for YTD 2023, down 12% from YTD 2022. These expenses represent\n36.8% of revenue for Q3 2023 and 39.4% of revenue for Q3 2022, and 41.4% of revenue for YTD 2023 and 37.5% of revenue for YTD 2022. In support of our strategy, described\nin our 2022 Form 10-K, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires continued investments in R&D and focused\nefforts to attract and retain talent. We have implemented certain cost-cutting measures while we continue to improve our product execution.

In YTD 2023, activity related to the 2022 Restructuring Program substantially related to cash settlement of previously accrued employee severance and benefit\narrangements as well as additional actions in Q2 and Q3 of 2023. We expect actions pursuant to the 2022 Restructuring Program to be substantially completed by the end of\n2023, but this is subject to change. We expect that our 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure and allow us to reinvest certain\nof these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy. The cumulative cost of the 2022\nRestructuring Program as of September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion. Litigation charges and other includes a $401 million charge in Q3 2023 for an EC-imposed fine.

Our effective tax rate increased in YTD 2023 compared to YTD 2022, due to the application of our actual YTD\neffective tax rate, and our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses. Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if\nany. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. In YTD 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.
