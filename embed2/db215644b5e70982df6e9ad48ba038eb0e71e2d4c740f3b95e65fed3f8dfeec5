In the third quarter of 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount. During the third quarter of 2022, we received proceeds of $140 million in the aggregate for the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler,\nArizona (CIDA). The bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with the loan agreement we entered into with the CIDA. The bonds mature in 2042 and carry an interest\nrate of 5.0%. The bonds are subject to mandatory tender in September 2027, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable\nrate-bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date. In the first quarter of 2022, we amended our $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning the\ninterest terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. The revolving credit facility had no borrowings outstanding as of October 1, 2022. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our commercial paper program. Our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain\nrestrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively\nrank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Level 2 investments consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and notes and bonds issued by financial\ninstitutions. Level 1 investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 investments consist primarily of U.S. agency notes and non-U.S. government debt. The fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance. Level 2 investments consist of marketable equity securities subject to security-specific restrictions. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nOur non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair\nvalue only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable\nequity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n15\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired\nin the current period, grants receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months, and issued debt. We classify the fair value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these\nfinancial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of October 1, 2022 was $569 million (the aggregate carrying value as of\nDecember 25, 2021 was $317 million). The aggregate carrying value of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of October 1, 2022 was\n$400 million (the aggregate carrying value as of December 25, 2021 was $0). We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding any commercial paper, drafts payable, and finance leases) as Level 2. The fair value of our issued debt was $34.8 billion as of\nOctober 1, 2022 ($41.5 billion as of December 25, 2021).

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\nThe before-tax net gains or losses attributed to cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) were $678 million net losses in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.6\nbillion net losses in the first nine months of 2022 ($28 million net losses in the third quarter of 2021 and $313 million net losses in the first nine months of 2021). Substantially all of our\ncash flow hedges were foreign currency contracts for all periods presented. During the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, the amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were insignificant.

This arrangement represents an equity partnership whereby we and\nBrookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively, of what will be a newly-formed entity, Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), which we will fully consolidate into our consolidated financial\nstatements. We expect Arizona Fab to spend up to $30.0 billion of investments in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at our Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona. Generally,\ncontributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based upon our and Brookfield\u2019s proportional ownership, subject to the terms and conditions within the\ndefinitive agreement. The definitive agreement includes provisions that require us to utilize Arizona Fab\u2019s expanded manufacturing capacity at specified minimum levels or be subject to\npenalties. Brookfield\u2019s ownership stake as a non-controlling interest holder in Arizona Fab will be shown as a separate component of equity within our consolidated balance sheet. The\ntransaction with Brookfield is expected to close by the end of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. In the first quarter of 2021, we accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI,\ndescribed below. Excluding this charge, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our\nfinancial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and\nunfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct\nremedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular\nbusiness practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall\ntrends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include\nsubstantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. European Commission Competition Matter\nIn 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade\ncustomers to buy our microprocessors. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area\nAgreement.", "vector": [[-0.0029917809, 0.02516095,
