Adjusted free cash\nflow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to\nproperty, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from\ncapital grants and partner contributions, (2) payments\non finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the McAfee\nequity sale. This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in\nunderstanding our capital requirements and sources of\nliquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate\nthe cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017\ndivestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales\ncontributed to prior operating and free cash flow, and\nwhile the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have\ntypically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as\nan equity sale, we believe including the sale proceeds in\nadjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, more\nconsistent comparison to past presentations of liquidity.

Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may\nnot entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity\nprices, and commodity prices refer to \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nRisk Factors\nThe risks described in \"Risk Factors\" within Other Key Information in our 2022 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face\u2014our operations could also be affected by factors that\nare not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may\nnot be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set\nforth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections. Controls and Procedures\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls\nmust be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\nmisstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on management\u2019s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that\nwe file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter\nended July 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market\nor negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending July 1, 2023. As of July 1, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of\nwhich $7.2 billion remained available. We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf\nof our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been\nissued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nOur directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares\nthat are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5\u20131(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the\nquarter ended July 1, 2023, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification. Other Key Information\n\n40\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nSection 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities,\ntransactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are\nconducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party\nsubject to one such sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct\nbusiness within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, Intel suspended all\nbusiness operations in Russia until further notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the\nsanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of\nsecurity vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly\nassociated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.
