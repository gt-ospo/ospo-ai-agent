{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 22, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q1 NVDA.txt:Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels even for our gaming products, negatively impacting our ability to serve\ndemand, even in markets outside China. Even the possibility of additional export controls may negatively impact demand for our products,\nbenefitting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are\nlikely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business. Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls may also impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our\nbusiness and financial results. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that\nnegatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional\nexport restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including\nChina, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which\ncould also substantially reduce our revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China\u2019s\nsemiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and\ntechnology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically\nimpact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicense requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance\nthresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of\nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. Following the 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations\nout of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and\nsupply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We have sold alternative products in China not subject to the license requirements, such as our A800 or H800 offerings. To the extent that a\ncustomer requires products covered by the license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG\nwill grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The requirements have a\ndisproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the\nnew restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be\nharmed if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls, if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings,\nif customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual\nwarranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers,\nor if we incur significant transition costs. Additionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess\ninventory, harming our\n\n41\n\n\fresults. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or\nchoose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale\ntechnical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including\nsemiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the\nUSG may unilaterally change the export control rules at any time and subject a wide range of our products, including but not limited to A800,\nH800, and gaming products such as RTX 4090, to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and\nfinancial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop\nreplacement products not subject to the license requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market. For example, the\nUSG has been under pressure from some commentators to impose strict conditions for export, such as requirements that every GPU above a\ncertain capability include tamper-proof means to automatically detect the configuration and use of a system as well as an \u201cauto-kill\u201d or \u201cautothrottle\u201d mechanism that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. Such restrictions would be infeasible,\nand if imposed by the USG, would be tantamount to a blanket export control on products exceeding the thresholds. Export controls restricting\nour gaming products, such as RTX 4090, may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of\nsuch products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a\nsubstantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell\ndatacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. Any new control that\nimpacts a wide range of our products, including but not limited to A800, H800, and RTX4090 would likely have a disproportionate impact on\nNVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.", "vector": [[0.050624117, 0.10268463, -0.15810728, 0.0028988686, -0.0072329063, 0.035212565, 0.004115312,
