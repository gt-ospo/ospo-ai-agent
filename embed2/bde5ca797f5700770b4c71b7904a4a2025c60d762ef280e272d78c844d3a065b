The 2006 Plan and Other Terms; Other Matters. (a)\nCertain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or\nnegotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006\nPlan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to you in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation to make a grant in any future year or in\nany given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b)\nTo the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your\ncountry of residence, only authorized but unissued shares thereof will be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. -4-\n\n\f(c)\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in law or the financial or tax accounting rules\napplicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement will occur, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, (1) modify this Agreement to impose\nsuch restrictions or procedures with respect to the RSUs (whether vested or unvested), the shares issued or issuable pursuant to the RSUs and/or\nany proceeds or payments from or relating to such shares as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or to\naddress, comply with or offset the economic effect to the Corporation of any accounting or administrative matters relating thereto, or (2) cancel\nand cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d)\nBecause this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel\nCorporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without\nregard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs\ngranted hereunder will be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (e)\nEach payment under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal\nRevenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d).", "vector": [[0.05414336, 0.061939456,
