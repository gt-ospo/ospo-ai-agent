We repurchased 46.2 million shares of\nour common stock for $6.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of our common stock during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program. Stock Award Activity\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30,\n2023. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the\napplicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,\nchanges in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be\nmore or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax\nrate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our\nability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. For 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development\ncredit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and\nmay cause variability in our effective tax rate.", "vector": [[0.05865081, 0.045585968,
