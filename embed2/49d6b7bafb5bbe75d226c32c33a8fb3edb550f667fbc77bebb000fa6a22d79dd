Our Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn,\nDynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $31.8 billion and $25.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. These amounts are primarily included in Server products and cloud services, Office products and cloud services,\nLinkedIn, and Dynamics in the table above. 27\n\n\fPART I\nItem 1\n\nAssets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various\nother costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and\ndepreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. NOTE 17 \u2014 SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nOn October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (\u201cActivision Blizzard\u201d) for a cash payment of $61.8 billion, net of\ncash acquired. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will\naccelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. Due to the limited amount of time since closing the transaction, the preliminary allocation of the purchase price is not yet complete. The initial\npurchase price allocation will be provided within our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, and we expect most of the\npurchase price will be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Activision Blizzard will be included in our consolidated\nfinancial statements beginning on the date of acquisition and reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment. 28\n\n\fPART I\nItem 1\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation\nResults of Review of Interim Financial Information\nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\u2019 equity for\nthe three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cinterim financial\ninformation\u201d). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim\nfinancial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated\nJuly 27, 2023, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth\nin the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the\nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of\napplying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less\nin scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an\nopinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nOctober 24, 2023\n29\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nITEM 2.", "vector": [[0.05817099, -0.017444076, -0.13550836,
