{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 50, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 MSFT.txt:We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These\nclaims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI\nservices, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or\nall of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the\nfuture. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable\noutcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government\ncontracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we\nmay be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental\ncontractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some\nagreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may\nbe subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our\nproducts and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. 61\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations\nwhere the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) and\npossible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates\nin our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and\nguidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more\nanalysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax\nestimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to\nincrease tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal\nRevenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits,\nand other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our\nconsolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country\nmay result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to\ncorporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in\ntaxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed\nprogram commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our\napplication and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of\nour source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third\nparties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized\ndisclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a\nglobal basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant,\nparticularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may\ngrow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure\nconsistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining\nindemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where\nintellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect\nrevenue. We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by\nincorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others\nin return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of\npatented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more\ndifficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail\nto satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to\nmonetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents,\ngreater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source\nsoftware will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. 62\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual\nproperty rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the\nextensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as\nSurface. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently\navailable, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief\nthat may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such\nas Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant\namounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of\nour strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are\nglobally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business,\nand public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality\nissues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from\ncustomers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or\npublic policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n\u2022\n\nThe introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. \u2022\n\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. \u2022\n\nData security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are\ndamaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession,\npandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs,\nservers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely\naffected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also\nbeen a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor,\nOEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a\nresult, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,\nmarket, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant\npart of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a\ndowngrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be\nadversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment\ncharges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 63\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because\nof a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing\nsales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business\noperations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the\ndestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could\nharm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a\npremium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of\nprolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic\ndisruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers\nin affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our\ncustomers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory\nsystems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global\nmarkets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with\nsome public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.", "vector": [[0.087643266,
