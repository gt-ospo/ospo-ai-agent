The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise\nexpressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the\nCommittee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are\notherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan\nafter the date hereof. 16. Entire Agreement. This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior\nunderstandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award\nAgreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The\nCompany may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the\nParticipant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any\nother provision hereof. 17. Limitation on the Participant\u2019s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This\nAward Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as\ncreating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a\ngeneral unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the RSUs, and rights\nno greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to RSUs, as and when payable hereunder. 18. Section Headings. The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed\nto alter or affect any provision hereof. 19. Governing Law.

Construction. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A\nof the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted with that intent. 6\n\n\f22. Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal\nor otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 23. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant\u2019s\nparticipation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or\nadvisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be\nnecessary to accomplish the foregoing. 7\n\n\fExhibit 10.2\n\nAPPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nPERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nNOTICE OF GRANT\nName:\n\n(the \u201cParticipant\u201d)\n\nEmployee ID:\nGrant Number:\nTarget No. of Units\nSubject to Award:\nAward Date:\n\n(the \u201cAward Date\u201d)\n\nVesting Date:\nPerformance Period:\nThis restricted stock unit award (the \u201cAward\u201d) is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Apple Inc. 2022\nEmployee Stock Plan and the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (including Exhibit A thereto), which are\nincorporated herein by reference. You do not have to accept the Award. If you wish to decline your Award, you should promptly notify Apple Inc.\u2019s Stock Plan Group of your\ndecision at peoplesupport@apple.com. If you do not provide such notification by the last day of the calendar month prior to the Vesting Date, you\nwill be deemed to have accepted your Award on the terms and conditions set forth herein. APPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\nPERFORMANCE AWARD\n1. General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (these \u201cTerms\u201d) apply to a particular\nrestricted stock unit award (the \u201cAward\u201d) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), and are incorporated by reference in\nthe Notice of Grant (the \u201cGrant Notice\u201d) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is\nreferred to as the \u201cParticipant.\u201d The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the \u201cAward Date.\u201d The\nAward was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the\n\u201cPlan\u201d). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the \u201cAward Agreement\u201d applicable to the\nAward. 2. RSUs. As used herein, the term \u201cRSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\nfor the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs\nshall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind. 3. Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and\nExhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \u201cVesting Date\u201d). 4. Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award\nAgreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any\nproportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of\nabsence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as\napproved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal\nleave of absence. Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant\u2019s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant\u2019s other\ncompensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant\nwithout the Participant\u2019s consent thereto. 1\n\n\f5.\n\nDividend and Voting Rights. (a) Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nbook entry evidencing such Shares. (b)\nDividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its\nShares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its\nShares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan)\nsubject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a \u201cDividend Equivalent Right\u201d). Any Dividend\nEquivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other\nterms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided,\nhowever, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend\nEquivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving\neffect to Exhibit A. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which,\nimmediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit\nA. 6. Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\ninterest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. 7. Timing and Manner of Payment of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to\nSection 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 \u00bd) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the\nParticipant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as\ndetermined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest (or, in the case of the Participant\u2019s\nRetirement, death or Disability, are treated as vesting) on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the\nVesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company\u2019s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested RSUs is\nsubject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested\nRSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The\nParticipant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8. 8. Effect of Termination of Service. (a)\nExcept as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant\u2019s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\nEquivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service, meaning\nthe first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the \u201cSeverance Date\u201d),\nregardless of the reason for the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the\nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date. 2\n\n\f(b)\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant\u2019s\nTermination of Service due to the Participant\u2019s Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, death or Disability,\nany unvested RSUs shall continue to be eligible to vest on the Vesting Date without regard to the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service. For\npurposes of this Award Agreement, \u201cRetirement\u201d means the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both has reached the\nage of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by\nthe Company), as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant\u2019s Termination of\nService occurs due to Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall\notherwise determine. (c)\nIf any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\nEquivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain\noutstanding following the Severance Date by reason of Section 8(b) but the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied,\nsuch RSUs shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without payment of any consideration\nby the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant\u2019s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be. 9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, \u201cclawback\u201d or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company\nmay require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n(a) during the period of the Participant\u2019s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the \u201cEmployment\nPeriod\u201d), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense\nunder the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of\nconfidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of\nthe Company or any of its Subsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,\nembezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its\nSubsidiaries. For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant\u2019s\nbehalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the Participant\u2019s Shares and other amounts\nacquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the\nCompany\u2019s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters. 10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company\u2019s stock contemplated by\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be\n\n3\n\n\fissued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent\nRights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b). 11. Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant\u2019s\nemployer (\u201cEmployer\u201d) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant\u2019s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that\nthe Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection\nwith any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any\nShares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no\nobligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant\u2019s liability for Tax-Related Items or\nachieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant\nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for TaxRelated Items in more than one jurisdiction. Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the\nCompany and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or\ntheir respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable\nwithholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:\n(a) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term cash incentives, payable to the Participant\nby the Company and/or the Employer;\n(b) withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid\nupon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c) arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant\u2019s behalf and at the Participant\u2019s\ndirection pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n(d)\n\nwithholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or\n\n(e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by\nApplicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then\nthe Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable,\nby withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method\n(b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of\nmethods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above. The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates,\nincluding maximum rates applicable in the Participant\u2019s jurisdictions(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded\nto the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek\na refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable\n\n4\n\n\ftax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described\nherein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding\nthat a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver\nto the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant\u2019s obligations in\nconnection with the Tax-Related Items. 12. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by\nelectronic means or request the Participant\u2019s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive\nall applicable documentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line (and/or voice activated) system established\nand maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company. 13. Data Privacy. The Participant acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as\ndescribed in this Section 13. The Company, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant,\nincluding the Participant\u2019s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number or other employee\nidentification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to\nShares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant\u2019s favor, for the purpose of\nmanaging and administering the Plan
