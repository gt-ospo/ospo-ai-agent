Luxembourg computed an\ninitial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission\u2019s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending\nconclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg\n\n18\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nappealed the European Commission\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European\nCommission\u2019s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in this matter. Note 8 \u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses\n\u201cFulfillment,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d \u201cSales and marketing,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment\nin which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the\nremaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue\ntransactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company\u2019s business\nperformance and manages its operations. North America\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions\nthrough North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through\ninternationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these\nonline stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government\nagencies, and academic institutions. 19\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nInformation on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022\n\n2023\n\nNorth America\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating income (loss)\n\n$\n\n69,244 $\n70,812\n(1,568) $\n\n76,881\n75,983\n898\n\n28,759 $\n30,040\n(1,281) $\n\n29,123\n30,370\n(1,247)\n\n18,441\n11,923\n6,518\n\n$\n\n21,354\n16,231\n5,123\n\n116,444\n112,775\n\n$\n\nInternational\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating loss\n\n$\n\nAWS\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating income\n\n$\n\n$\n\nConsolidated\nNet sales\n\n$\n\nOperating expenses\nOperating income\n\n127,358\n122,584\n\n3,669\n\n4,774\n\nTotal non-operating expense\n\n(8,934)\n\n(655)\n\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n\n1,422\n(1)\n(3,844) $\n\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax\nNet income (loss)\n\n$\n\n20\n\n(948)\n1\n3,172\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nNet sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar economic characteristics, is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022\n\n2023\n\nNet Sales:\nOnline stores (1)\n\n$\n\nPhysical stores (2)\nThird-party seller services (3)\n\n51,129\n\n$\n\n51,096\n\n4,591\n\n4,895\n\n25,335\n\n29,820\n\nSubscription services (4)\n\n8,410\n\n9,657\n\nAdvertising services (5)\n\n7,877\n\n9,509\n\n18,441\n\n21,354\n\nAWS\nOther (6)\n$\n\nConsolidated\n\n661\n116,444\n\n$\n\n1,027\n127,358\n\n____________________________\n(1) Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross.
