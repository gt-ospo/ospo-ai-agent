{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt:The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits\nfrom the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. For the first half of fiscal year 2024, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax\njurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Additionally, there have\nbeen no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not\nthat the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are\nmade or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of July 30, 2023, we do not believe that\nour estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. 12\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nNote 7 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities are classified as \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d debt securities.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating\nexpenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded\nin accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized\nin earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities\nthat are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged\nforeign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

Litigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint\non May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment\n\n20\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit\npanel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district\ncourt did not err in dismissing the case. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the\nplaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit\nasserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\nwaste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false\nand misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\nresolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf\nof us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of\ninformation, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly\nfalse, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek\nunspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance\nmeasures.
