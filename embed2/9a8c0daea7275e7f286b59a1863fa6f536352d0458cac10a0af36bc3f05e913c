{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 18, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 AMZN.txt:The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior year\nperiods, is primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by\n$35 million for Q2 2023, and by $431 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes\nfrom sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Infrastructure\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing\nproducts and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores,\nand infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and\nother expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide\nvariety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and\nelectronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve\nour process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and\ncapital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and\noperations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are\nallocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30,\n2023, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for\nexpanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on infrastructure. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $95 million for Q2 2023, and by $399 million for the six months ended June\n30, 2023. See Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Overview\u201d of our 2022 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\ncommissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and\nonline advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales\nand changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we\nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior\nyear periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view\nthese offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable\nprior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses. 27\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $90 million and $146 million for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $339 million and $369 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities\nin 2023, and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense\nOur interest income was $159 million and $661 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $267 million and $1.3 billion for the six months ended June\n30, 2022 and 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment\ngrade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the\nprevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $584 million and $840 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30,\n2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 3 \u2014 Leases and Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for\nadditional information. Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was $(5.5) billion and $61 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(14.1) billion and $(382) million for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 and 2023. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity\nwarrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(3.9) billion and\n$187 million in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(11.5) billion and $(280) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in\nRivian.", "vector": [[0.030134711, 0.046563745, -0.16089348, -0.031111134, 0.021311903, -0.009566714, 0.04568318,
