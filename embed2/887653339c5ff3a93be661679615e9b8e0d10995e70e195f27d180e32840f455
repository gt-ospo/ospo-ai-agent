{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 35, "chunk_text": "From text/2022 Q3 MSFT.txt:Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual\nproperty rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the\nextensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as\nSurface. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently\navailable, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief\nthat may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such\nas Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant\namounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of\nour strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are\nglobally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business,\nand public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality\nissues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from\ncustomers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or\npublic policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n\u2022\n\nThe introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. \u2022\n\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. \u2022\n\nData security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are\ndamaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession,\npandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs,\nservers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely\naffected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also\nbeen a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor,\nOEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a\nresult, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. 58\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,\nmarket, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant\npart of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a\ndowngrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be\nadversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment\ncharges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because\nof a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing\nsales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business\noperations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the\ndestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could\nharm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a\npremium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of\nprolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic\ndisruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers\nin affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our\ncustomers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory\nsystems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global\nmarkets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with\nsome public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society,\neconomies, financial markets, and business practices. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend\non factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic;\nand the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors. Any of these measures may adversely\nimpact our ability to:\n\u2022\n\nMaintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services. \u2022\n\nSatisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through\ndatacenter load balancing. \u2022\n\nEnsure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter\noperations. \u2022\n\nEffectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies. \u2022\n\nHire and deploy people where we most need them. \u2022\n\nSustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations, including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution\nfunctions. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our\nrevenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or\nchanges in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services,\nincluding natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and\ncooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. 59\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant\npart of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as\nwell as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which\npresents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in\nstaffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment,\nand political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or\nagreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and nonlocal sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in\nforeign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and\nservices, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency\nexposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of\noperations.", "vector": [[0.06826377, 0.05644245, -0.16843043, 0.0123114595, 0.050617494, 0.06703212, 0.018049031, -0.026689198, 0.05867075, -0.0037337213, 0.003177415, 0.007087172, 0.008661283,
