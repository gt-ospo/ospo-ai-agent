Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by\n$32 million for Q2 2023, and negatively impacted operating loss by $142 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior\nyear periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by\nadditional investments to support AWS business growth, partially offset by increased sales.

The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior year periods,\nis primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign\nexchange rates reduced cost of sales by $208 million for Q2 2023, and by $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our\ncustomers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $19.3 billion and $20.5 billion in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023,\nand $38.9 billion and $40.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our\ncustomers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to\nmitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our\nsuppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way\nwe offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and infrastructure\u201d as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both\nour internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. Fulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical\nstores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing\n\n26\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nand related transaction costs are included in \u201cFulfillment,\u201d AWS costs are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and infrastructure.\u201d Fulfillment costs as a\npercentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy,\nchanges in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of\nfulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our\nability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because\npayment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.", "vector": [[0.03214137, 0.11952751, -0.12545343, -0.019258704, 0.065192506, -0.043852173, 0.037478417, -0.026560605, 0.07303828, 0.04296024,
