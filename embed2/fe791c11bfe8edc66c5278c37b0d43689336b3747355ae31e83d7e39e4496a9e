{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt:As of July 30, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $3.95\nbillion. On August 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.00 billion,\nwithout expiration. As of August 24, 2023, a total of $27.95 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset\ndilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment\nopportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess\nof shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements. Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of July 30, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:\nJuly 30, 2023\n(In millions)\nDue in one year\nDue in one to five years\nDue in five to ten years\nDue in greater than ten years\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\nNet carrying amount\nLess short-term portion\nTotal long-term portion\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,250\n2,250\n2,750\n3,500\n(45)\n9,705\n(1,249)\n8,456\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of July 30, 2023, we had not issued any\ncommercial paper. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.25 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $128 million recorded in non-current income\ntax payable as of July 30, 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in\nindividual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We\nare currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our\ncontractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. Refer to Item 7,\n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our\noperating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements, respectively. 33\n\n\fClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from\nsourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of July 30, 2023, there have been no\nmaterial changes to the financial market risks described as of January 29, 2023. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of July 30, 2023, there have\nbeen no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 29, 2023. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of July 30, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide reasonable\nassurance. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or\nERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial\nrecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes\nthat materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\nNVIDIA have been detected.
