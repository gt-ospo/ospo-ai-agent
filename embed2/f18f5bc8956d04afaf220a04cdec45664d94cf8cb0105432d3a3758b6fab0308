We have accrued\na charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at\npresent believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial\nposition, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject\nto inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include\nsubstantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate\nmonetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could\ninclude an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular\nbusiness practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests\nof our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically\ndescribed below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n18\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nEuropean Commission Competition Matter\nIn 2009, the European Commission (EC) found that Intel had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy\nmicroprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area\nAgreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged \u201cconditional rebates and payments\u201d that required\ncustomers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged \u201cpayments to prevent sales of specific rival\nproducts.\u201d The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a \u20ac1.1 billion fine, which we paid in\nthe third quarter of 2009. We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance)\nrejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to\nexamine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC\u2019s 2009 findings against Intel regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel,\nwhich was returned to us in February 2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing\ndate on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court\u2019s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC\u2019s 2009 finding that Intel\nmade payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrative procedure to\ndetermine a fine against Intel based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding, we are\nunable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately\n\u20ac593 million in default interest, which applications have been stayed pending the EC\u2019s appeal of the General Court\u2019s January 2022\ndecision. Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly\nreferred to as \u201cSpectre\u201d and \u201cMeltdown,\u201d that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings\nlike these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate\nsoftware and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly\nreported before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have\nbeen identified since 2018. As of January 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against Intel were pending in the United States,\nCanada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have\nbeen harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and\nstatutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were\nconsolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in\nJuly 2022 based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In\nCanada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a\nstay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and\nresponded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other\nrelated relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural\nposture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not\nbeen specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if\ncertified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the\npotential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement\nMultiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain\nofficers following Intel\u2019s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs\nin October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or\notherwise acquired Intel common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants\nviolated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, with leave to amend. Given the procedural posture and the nature\nof the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the\nlikelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be\nresolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In\nJuly 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4. Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n19\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nLitigation Related to Patent and IP Claims\nWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain\nof our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial\nfines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products,\nor services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could\nresult in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to\nindemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require\nthat we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse\nruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as\na result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business. VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel\nIn October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the US District Court for the Northern District of California\nalleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents that VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). Four patents remain at issue in the case, and VLSI estimates its damages to be approximately $900 million, and seeks enhanced\ndamages, future royalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. Intel filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board (PTAB) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the PTAB's\nreview. The PTAB subsequently found all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district\ncourt lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled trial for March 2024 on the claims that were found patentable by the PTAB. In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in US District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking $4.4 billion in damages for\nthe alleged infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents that VLSI acquired from NXP. In December 2022, VLSI\nstipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claims, for which Intel paid nothing. The court dismissed the case in January 2023.", "vector": [[0.052736033, 0.00207026, -0.0775368, -0.049569756, -0.001813463, 0.0012707479, -0.020707894, -0.03291237, 0.0035210303, -0.002953165,
