The decrease in our\neffective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and U.S. Treasury\nDepartment, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings\ntaxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional\noperations center in Ireland. Uncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $19.8 billion and $18.7 billion,\nrespectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023,\nwe received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer\npricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we\nbelieve our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the\nNOPAs through the IRS\u2019s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these\nissues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our\nincome tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for\ntax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected\nto be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire\nNokia\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are\nconsolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cFCC Guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that\ntheir handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits\nalso allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.", "vector": [[-0.022852276, -0.00283841, -0.0938533, 0.03502669, -0.017606556,
