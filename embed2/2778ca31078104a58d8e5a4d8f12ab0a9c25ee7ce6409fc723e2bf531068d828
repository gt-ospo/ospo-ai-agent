{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 AAPL.txt", "chunk_index": 10, "chunk_text": "Provision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were\nas follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\n\nProvision for income taxes\nEffective tax rate\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n\n$\n\n5,625\n$\n15.8 %\n21 %\n\nDecember 25,\n2021\n\n6,611\n16.0 %\n21 %\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on\nforeign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit,\nlower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and\ncontinued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company\u2019s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing\npurchase obligations. Commercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 19\n\n\fManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of\nfinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\nobligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program\n(the \u201cProgram\u201d) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was\n$0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company\u2019s discussion\nand analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the\namounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and\nmethods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s\ncritical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s market risk during the first three months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company\u2019s exposure to\nmarket risk, refer to the Company\u2019s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d of the 2022\nForm 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) were effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to\nbe disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer\nand principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 20\n\n\fPART II \u2014 OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cNorthern California District Court\u201d) against the\nCompany alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company\u2019s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d When any one or more of these risks\nmaterialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely\naffected. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 2.
