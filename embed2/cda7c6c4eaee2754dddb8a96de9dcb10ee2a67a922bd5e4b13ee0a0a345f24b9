The Company and its affiliates, and Awardee, are referred to below as \u201cparties.\u201d\nThe parties agree to first attempt to resolve all disputes through informal negotiations. The party asserting the dispute shall provide written\nnotice to the other party describing with specificity the nature of the dispute. Written notice to Awardee shall be delivered to Awardee\u2019s home\naddress appearing in the Company\u2019s records. Written notice to the Company shall be delivered to the attention of its General Counsel. Within five days after delivery of the written notice, the other party shall respond in writing stating its position. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve all disputes by binding arbitration\nbefore a single qualified mutually selected arbitrator in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the\nAmerican Arbitration Association. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, each party shall select a representative and those two\nrepresentatives shall select a qualified arbitrator who shall preside over the arbitral proceeding. The party initiating the arbitration normally\nshall bear the burden of proof and normally must prove any actual damages sought, but these proof issues will be determined by applicable\nlaw.

This Section 19 shall survive the employer-employee relationship between the Company and Awardee. 20. Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Award Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the\nvalidity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable provisions shall be deemed null and void; however, to the extent permissible by law, any provisions that could be deemed null\nand void shall first be construed, interpreted or revised retroactively to permit this Award Agreement to be construed so as to foster the intent\nof this Award Agreement and the Plan. 21.
