{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_text": "This defect has had, and other\ndefects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. While we have been working to fix\nthe defect, we have needed to replace those products instead of repairing them, resulting in greater costs to us. These costs could be significant\nin future periods. We recorded $122 million for warranty reserves in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this\ndefect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for the warranty reserve, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our\nestimate proves to be incorrect. Additionally, we are investigating failures of power connectors shipped with our recently launched GeForce RTX\n4090, which may harm sales of the 4090 or future products. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against\nus, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim\ncould be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business\nliability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial\nresults. Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\ntelecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other\nmilitary actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large\nportion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical\nbusiness operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural\ndisasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have\nan impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also\nlikely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if\nmanufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages,\ninformation technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,\n\n38\n\n\fenvironmental, public health, or political issues. For example, the war in Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on\nour employees or operations both within and outside Ukraine. In connection with multiple sanctions on Russia, we stopped direct sales to Russia\nin the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and closed business operations in Russia in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the ongoing\nwar could result in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The ultimate impact\non us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a\ndisaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a\nresult of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks\nand conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and\nrecruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry\u2019s highly competitive\nmarket for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and\ndevelop diverse talent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to\nattract and retain qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our business may\nbe adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of\nstock price volatility, as we have experienced recently, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. We also must retain\nthe key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent\non the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth\ntransitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors\nand suppliers. As the pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and the limited\navailability of our supply chain, logistical services and component supply, may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial\nresults. COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support\noperations, which could limit our capacity to meet customer demand. For example, ongoing lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment\nefforts in China have impacted end customer sales, disrupted our partners\u2019 operations, created logistics and delivery bottlenecks, and further\ncurtailed supply, and may continue to do so in the future. COVID-19\u2019s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and may continue to result in,\ndisruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact\noverall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock. We have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as required by government\nregulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to\nmitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. As our offices have reopened, we have\nincurred and expect to continue to incur incremental expenses and related in-office costs as we resume onsite services. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business\nstrategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. We have experienced supply chain and economic disruption, in part as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic which has negatively impacted and could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and access to sources of liquidity. Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\nactions may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business\n\n39\n\n\facquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\nemployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,\nand may impact our business operations negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and\nregulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or\nagents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of\nthese laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our\nbusiness; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we\ncould incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. For\nexample, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative\nrule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public\nconcern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions\ncould affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to\ntime), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the war in\nUkraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional\nsanctions or export control measures, which have resulted in and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete\nrestrictions on exports to and other commerce and business dealings involving Russia, Belarus, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular\nentities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and\nsupport into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, which may result in claims\nbrought against us for failure to fulfill our contractual obligations, and restrict access by our employees (both within and outside of Ukraine) to our\nsystems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign\ngovernment bodies, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we paused all direct sales to Russia, and during the third quarter of fiscal year\n2023, we closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue\nto do so in the future. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions, our\nemployees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately\nheld responsible. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if\nthe violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a\nmaterial and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of\ngovernments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of\nour product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies,\nexport controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets,\nhiring, and profitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that\ntarget products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings.", "vector": [[0.028622065, -0.024894003, -0.13500835, -0.010357679, 0.05191983, 0.02516442, -0.031536255, 0.012916948, 0.017301358,
