{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 16, "chunk_text": "Cash\noutflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and\nfinancing obligations of $5.1 billion and $9.4 billion in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $14.7 billion and $34.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30,\n2021 and 2022. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $1.7 billion and $131 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $5.5 billion and\n$358 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, $11.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs, and $1.0\nbillion of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2022. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for\nadditional information. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in\nthe U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the\nU.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions and\nincreased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing\nthe election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are\nrequired to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $750\nmillion and $742 million for Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $260 million and $231 million. See\nItem 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional discussion\nof our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for\ninventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open\npurchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing\narrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs\nand cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or\ndebt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies\nare contributing to rising interest rates, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. 23\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nResults of Operations\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates\nits business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 8 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d\nOverview\nMacroeconomic factors, including increased inflation and interest rates, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain constraints, and global\neconomic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. These factors\ncontributed to increases in our operating costs during Q3 2022, particularly across our North America and International segments, primarily due to a return to\nmore normal, seasonal demand volumes in relation to our fulfillment network fixed costs, increased transportation and utility costs, and increased wage rates. In addition, rising fuel, utility, and food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand. We expect some or all of these factors\nto continue to impact our operations into Q4 2022. Net Sales\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\nwhere we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping\nfees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions.

Changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(5.0) billion for Q3 2022 and by $(10.5) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For a\ndiscussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d below. North America sales increased 20% in Q3 2022, and 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by\nour continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. 24\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nInternational sales decreased 5% in Q3 2022, and 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the comparable prior year periods,\nprimarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales,\nand subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including\nfrom our shipping offers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(4.9) billion for Q3 2022, and by $(10.2) billion for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022. AWS sales increased 27% in Q3 2022, and 32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales\ngrowth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.
