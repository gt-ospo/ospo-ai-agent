Restructuring charges are recorded as Corporate charges in the \"all other\" category presented in Note 2: Operating Segments within Notes to\nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements and are primarily comprised of employee severance and benefits arrangements. As of October 1, 2022 we recorded $537 million as a\ncurrent liability within Accrued compensation and benefits on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of the first\nhalf of 2023, but they are subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Program will be reflected in our future results of operations. Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in the first nine months of 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and paid in 2009, and a\ncharge of $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 related to the VLSI litigation. These were recorded as a Corporate benefit and charge in the \"all other\" category presented in \"Note\n2: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Refer to \"Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed\nFinancial Statements for further information on legal proceedings related to the EC fine and the VLSI litigation. Asset impairment charges includes $237 million of goodwill and other impairments related to the shutdown in the first nine months of 2021 of two of our non-strategic businesses, the\nresults of which are included in the \u201call other\u201d category presented in \u201cNote 2: Operating Segments\u201d within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Note 6 :\n\nInvestments\n\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Government debt includes instruments such as\nnon-U.S. government bonds and U.S. agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as\ncommercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of October 1, 2022 and December 25, 2021, substantially all time deposits were\nissued by institutions outside the U.S.\nFor certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to\neconomically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related\nderivative instruments recorded in Interest and other, net.", "vector": [[0.07539326,
