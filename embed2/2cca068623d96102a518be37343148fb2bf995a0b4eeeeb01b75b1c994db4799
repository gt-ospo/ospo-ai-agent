The cumulative cost of the 2022 Restructuring Program as of September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion. Litigation charges and other includes a $401 million charge in the third quarter of 2023 for an EC-imposed fine. In 2009, we recorded and paid an EC fine that was subsequently\nannulled, resulting in a benefit of $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 13: Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for\nfurther information on legal proceedings related to the EC fine. Also in the third quarter of 2023 we mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the agreement we entered into during the first quarter of 2022 to acquire Tower in a cash-for-stock\ntransaction, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. We mutually agreed to terminate the agreement due to our inability to\nobtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner and we paid a termination fee in accordance with the terms of the agreement, resulting in a $353 million charge included\nin Litigation charges and other.

Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. During the first nine months of 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in\nmultiple tax jurisdictions. Note 8 :\n\nInvestments\n\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds\nand US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and\nfloating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by\ninstitutions outside the US. For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is\nused to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments\nand the related derivative instruments recorded in interest and other, net.", "vector": [[0.05437392,
