{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 INTC.txt", "chunk_index": 19, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 INTC.txt:In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a\ndisproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid. Trial is scheduled for December 2023 in the Dusseldorf Regional Court, and for April 2024 in the UK High Court of Justice. If defendants lose at trial in Germany, the Dusseldorf\nRegional Court could impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of the accused products in Germany which could take effect immediately and remain in place unless\noverturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there\nare significant factual and legal issues to be resolved and that uncertainty exists as to the scope of an injunction, if any, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the\npotential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these lawsuits.

We previously announced the organizational change to integrate AXG into CCG and DCAI to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these\nbusinesses while further reducing costs. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All\nprior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023. \"Note 2: Operating Segments\u201d within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total\nrevenues, and our segment operating margin (loss) presented below to our total operating margin (loss), for each of the periods presented. For additional key highlights of our results of operations, see \"A Quarter in Review.\" Client Computing\nWe are committed to advancing PC experiences by delivering an annual cadence of leadership products and deepening our relationships with industry partners to co-engineer\nand deliver leading platform innovation. We engage in an intentional effort focused on a long-term operating system, system architecture, hardware, and application integration\nthat enables industry-leading PC experiences. We are embracing these opportunities by simplifying and focusing our roadmap, ramping PC capabilities even more aggressively,\nand designing PC experiences even more deliberately. By doing this, we believe we will continue to fuel innovation across Intel, providing a growing source of IP, scale, and cash\nflow.
