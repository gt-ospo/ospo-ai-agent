{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 NVDA.txt:Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets\noutside China and for our gaming products. Even the possibility of additional export controls may also negatively impact demand for our\nproducts, benefitting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control\nrules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business. Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls may also impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our\nbusiness and financial results. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that\nnegatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional\nexport restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including\nChina, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which\ncould also substantially reduce our revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China\u2019s\nsemiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and\ntechnology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically\nimpact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicense requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance\nthresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of\nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out\nof China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and\nsupply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We have sold alternative products in China not subject to the license requirements, such as our A800 or H800 offerings. To the extent that a\ncustomer requires products covered by the license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG\nwill grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner. The requirements have a disproportionate impact\non NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may\nbe able to acquire licenses for their products. Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be\nharmed, especially over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic,\ncustomer, or product scope of the controls, if affected customers do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers\npurchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other\nextended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur\nsignificant transition costs. Additionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings to affected customers, we may have excess\ninventory, harming our results. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions\nthat we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements\n\n43\n\n\fmay benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome\nand less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China,\nEurope, and Israel. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG may unilaterally change the export\ncontrol rules at any time and subject a wide range of our products, including but not limited to A800, H800, and gaming products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable\nto sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the license requirements, effectively\nexcluding us from all or part of the China market. For example, the USG has reportedly been urged to impose conditions to limit the ability of\nforeign firms to create large-scale GPU clusters, for example by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair\nGPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. Such restrictions would be technically and commercially infeasible, and if imposed by the\nUSG, would effectively prevent exports of products exceeding the thresholds to impacted regions and customers.", "vector": [[0.051641133, 0.131323, -0.16347231, 0.00954658, 0.039851695, 0.0185382, 0.00887253, 0.015438042, 0.020546949, -0.03142299, 0.055079702, 0.047748327, 0.033495158, 0.014275417,
