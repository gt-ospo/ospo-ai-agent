LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to\nbe sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share\nrepurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), for at least\nthe next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $99.5 billion and $104.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,\nrespectively. Equity investments were $7.1 billion and $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Our short-term\ninvestments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade\nfixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated\nsecurities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest\nrate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that\ncorrelate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term\ninvestments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. 43\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nValuation\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our\nfinancial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and\npreferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value,\nthen we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\nindirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency\nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3\ninvestments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide\na quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is\nused mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more\nreflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2\ninvestments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all\nour broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these\ninvestments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls\ninclude model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices\nwhere appropriate. Cash Flows\nCash from operations decreased $4.7 billion to $34.4 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash\npaid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers.", "vector": [[0.055521388, 0.06276517, -0.16592354, -0.015927505, 0.037309214, 0.00076229806, 0.07239101, -0.008670491,
