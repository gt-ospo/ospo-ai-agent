We expect that our 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure and allow us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in\nresources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our IDM 2.0 strategy. Employee severance and benefit arrangements includes charges incurred to date under the 2022 Restructuring Program of $607 million, which was approved in Q3 2022 and expected\nto be substantially completed by the end of the first half of 2023, but is subject to change.

In YTD 2022, we recognized a\nbenefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in YTD 2021 due to lower income before taxes, a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and a\nchange in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 2022. These YTD 2022 impacts were partially offset by the\nunfavorable tax rate effects associated with the gains recognized in YTD 2022 from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business. In Q3 2021 and YTD\n2021, we recognized one-time tax benefits from the restructuring of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.

We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our\ntotal cash and investments1, as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements\ninclude capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential\nand pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of $5.4 billion associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding\nrequirements incrementally contemplate additional investments in the significant manufacturing expansion plans we announced as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy and additional\ninvestments to accelerate our process technology. Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts\nor payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and\nconditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and beginning in Q3 2022,\nselling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. In the third quarter of 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount. We\nare using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations. We intend to use the proceeds from the remainder of the\noffering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also received proceeds\nof $140 million in the aggregate from the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA). In the first quarter of 2022 we amended\nour $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning the interest terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. Other\npotential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified\namount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of\nOctober 1, 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings on the revolving credit facility. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing\nreceivables are in investment-grade securities.

The decrease in cash provided by operations in YTD 2022 was primarily driven by lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the\npre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND business; and was also affected by cash-unfavorable working capital changes. Investing Activities\nInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; cash used for acquisitions; and proceeds from divestitures. Cash used for investing activities was lower in YTD 2022 compared to YTD 2021, primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-term investments, proceeds from the\ndivestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Financing Activities\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, proceeds from the sale of shares of common\nstock through employee equity incentive plans, and repurchases of common stock. Cash used for financing activities was lower in YTD 2022 compared to YTD 2021, primarily due to our curtailment of common stock repurchases and higher debt issuance, offset by\nhigher debt repayments.
