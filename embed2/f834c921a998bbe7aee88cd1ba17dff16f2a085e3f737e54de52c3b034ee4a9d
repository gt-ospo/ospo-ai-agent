We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over\nRivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on Rivian\u2019s board\nof directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on our consolidated\nbalance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and\n\n8\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\n$2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023.
