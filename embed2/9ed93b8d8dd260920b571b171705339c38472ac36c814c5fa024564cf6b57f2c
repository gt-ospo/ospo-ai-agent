{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 34, "chunk_text": "We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These\nclaims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, significant\nbusiness transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in\nsignificant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other\nclaims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in\nour consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and\nreasonably estimable. 56\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government\ncontracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we\nmay be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental\ncontractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some\nagreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may\nbe subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our\nproducts and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations\nwhere the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) and\npossible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates\nin our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and\nguidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more\nanalysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax\nestimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to\nincrease tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal\nRevenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits,\nand other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our\nconsolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country\nmay result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to\ncorporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in\ntaxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed\nprogram commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our\napplication and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of\nour source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third\nparties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized\ndisclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a\nglobal basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant,\nparticularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may\ngrow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure\nconsistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining\nindemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where\nintellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect\nrevenue. 57\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nWe expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by\nincorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others\nin return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of\npatented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more\ndifficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail\nto satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to\nmonetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents,\ngreater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source\nsoftware will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue.",
