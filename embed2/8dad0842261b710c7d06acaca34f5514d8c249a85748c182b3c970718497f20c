We expect the macroeconomic uncertainty and the\nchallenging market environment will extend into 2023. Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021\nOur Q3 2022 revenue was $15.3 billion, down $3.9 billion or 20% from Q3 2021. CCG revenue decreased 17% from Q3 2021 due to lower Notebook volume in the consumer and\neducation market segments, though Notebook ASPs increased due to a resulting change in product mix. CCG also had lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of\nour 5G smartphone modem business. DCAI revenue decreased 27% from Q3 2021. Server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases\nto reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of revenue from hyperscale customers within a competitive environment. NEX revenue increased 14% from Q3 2021, primarily due to increased demand for 5G products, higher Ethernet demand and ASPs, and accelerated demand for Edge products,\npartially offset by decreased demand for Network Xeon. The decrease in \"all other\" revenue reflects revenue of $1.1 billion in Q3 2021 related to the divested NAND memory business\nfor which historical results are recorded in \u201call other.\" Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, as\nwell as increased demand from customers in advance of fourth quarter 2022 price increases, contributed approximately $1.5 billion to our revenue during the third quarter of 2022, the\nimpacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 as included in our Form 8-K dated October 27, 2022. YTD 2022 vs. YTD 2021\nOur YTD 2022 revenue was $49.0 billion, down $9.5 billion or 16% from YTD 2021. CCG revenue was down 18% from YTD 2021 due to lower Notebook and Desktop volume, and\nlower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business. Notebook volume decreased driven by lower demand in the consumer and\neducation market segments, though ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. Desktop volume decreased driven by lower demand for consumer and education products. DCAI\nrevenue decreased 8% from YTD 2021 led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server\nASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased 16%, driven by increased demand for Ethernet and 5G products, accelerated demand for Edge products,\nand higher ASPs, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon. Mobileye revenue increased 27% from YTD 2021 primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. The\ndecrease in our \"all other\" revenue is due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of $3.3 billion recognized in YTD 2021 for which historical results are recorded in \u201call\nother\u201d, and $584 million of revenue recognized in YTD 2021 from a prepaid customer supply customer. Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In\n2021, continued strong COVID-driven Notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. For the remainder of 2022, we continue to\nexpect a flatter trend than we historically observed as we experience the uncertainty and impacts, including on demand and the supply chain, of current macroeconomic conditions, the\npotential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns. MD&A\n\n34\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nGross Margin\nWe derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin in Q3 2022, and most of our gross margin in YTD 2022, from the sale of products in the CCG and DCAI operating\nsegments.

These expenses represent 39% of\nrevenue for Q3 2022 and 29% of revenue for Q3 2021, and 37% of revenue for YTD 2022 and 27% of revenue for YTD 2021. In support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, described in our 2021\nForm 10-K, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D, and an intensified effort to attract\nand retain talent. We expect to complete the year with total R&D and MG&A expenses roughly flat in the second half of 2022 relative to the first half of 2022, as we continue to\nimplement certain cost-cutting measures, including slowing the pace of hiring, while at the same time continuing to improve our product execution in response to the continued decline in\nthe broader macroeconomic environment.
