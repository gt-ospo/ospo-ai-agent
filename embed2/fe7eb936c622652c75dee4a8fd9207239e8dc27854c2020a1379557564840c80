Our effective tax rate increased in YTD 2023 compared to YTD 2022, due to the application of our actual YTD\neffective tax rate, and our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses. Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if\nany. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. In the second quarter of 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax\njurisdictions. MD&A\n\n34\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:\n(In Millions)\n\nJul 1, 2023\n\nCash and cash equivalents\nShort-term investments\n\nDec 31, 2022\n\n$\n\n8,349\n15,908\n\nTotal cash and investments1\n\n$\n\nTotal debt\n\n$\n\nLoans receivable and other\n\n$\n\n11,144\n17,194\n\n24,321\n\n$\n\n28,801\n\n49,046\n\n$\n\n42,051\n\n64\n\n463\n\nWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and our total\ncash and investments1 as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further\nsupplemented by the company's committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide\nmanufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic\ninvestments, and dividends. This includes the commitment associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate\ninvestments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. Our total cash and investments1 and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain\ncash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our\npayment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices,\nand selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements and/or potentially curtail planned investments. In the first quarter of 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is\nexpected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. In the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of\noutstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement, extending the\nmaturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources of\nliquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of\ndebt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of July 1,\n2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and\nfinancing receivables were in investment-grade securities. Our sources of liquidity in the second quarter of 2023 included net proceeds of $1.6 billion from a secondary offering of Mobileye class A common stock, after which we retained\n88% of Mobileye\u2019s capital stock.
