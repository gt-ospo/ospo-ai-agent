We expect to recognize approximately 42% of this revenue over the next\ntwelve months and the remainder thereafter. This excludes revenue related to performance obligations for contracts with a length of one year or\nless. Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating\nexpenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded\nin accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized\nin earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities\nthat are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged\nforeign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:\nOctober 29,\n2023\nDesignated as cash flow hedges\nNon-designated hedges\n\n$\n$\n\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n\n(In millions)\n1,148\n$\n365\n$\n\n1,128\n366\n\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of October 29, 2023 and\nJanuary 29, 2023.

The expected realized gains and losses\ndeferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was\nnot significant. During the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting\ntreatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. 18\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nNote 12 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nThe carrying value of our outstanding notes, the calendar year of maturity, and the associated interest rates were as follows:\nCarrying Value at\nExpected\nRemaining Term\n(years)\n\nEffective\nInterest Rate\n\n\u2014\n0.6\n2.9\n4.6\n6.4\n7.6\n16.4\n26.4\n36.4\n\n0.41%\n0.66%\n3.31%\n1.64%\n2.93%\n2.09%\n3.54%\n3.54%\n3.73%\n\n0.309% Notes Due 2023\n0.584% Notes Due 2024\n3.20% Notes Due 2026\n1.55% Notes Due 2028\n2.85% Notes Due 2030\n2.00% Notes Due 2031\n3.50% Notes Due 2040\n3.50% Notes Due 2050\n3.70% Notes Due 2060\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\nNet carrying amount\nLess short-term portion\nTotal long-term portion\n\nOctober 29,\n2023\n$\n\n$\n\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n\n(In millions)\n\u2014 $\n1,250\n1,000\n1,250\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n2,000\n500\n(44)\n9,706\n(1,249)\n8,457 $\n\n1,250\n1,250\n1,000\n1,250\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n2,000\n500\n(47)\n10,953\n(1,250)\n9,703\n\nAll our notes are unsecured senior obligations.

Litigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint\non May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment\n\n20\n\n\fNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit\npanel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district\ncourt did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth\nCircuit panel\u2019s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the\nplaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. Following the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s denial of NVIDIA\u2019s petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in this\nderivative matter. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of\nfiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the\ndissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU\ndemand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA\u2019s corporate governance\nand internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\nresolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. Following the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial of NVIDIA\u2019s\npetition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in these derivative matters. The lawsuits\nassert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\ninsider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on\nthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU\ndemand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and\nunspecified corporate governance measures. Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang,\net al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. Accounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of October 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based\non our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in\nthese matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.
