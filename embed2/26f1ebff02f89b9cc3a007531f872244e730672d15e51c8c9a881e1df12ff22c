Cash outflows from\nfinancing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock,\n\n23\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\npayments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $11.8 billion and $6.4 billion in Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $166 million and $8 million during Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities, $7.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the commercial\npaper programs, $972 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, and $8.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan as of\nMarch 31, 2023. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional information. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in\nthe U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the\nU.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development\nexpenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily\nequipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and\ndevelopment expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. As a result, we\nexpect the cash taxes we pay in 2023 to increase significantly. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $453 million and $619 million for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $365 million and $391 million. See\nItem 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional discussion\nof our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for\ninventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open\npurchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing\narrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs\nand cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or\ndebt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies\nare contributing to rising interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future\nborrowing costs. 24\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nResults of Operations\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates\nits business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 8 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d\nOverview\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and\ngeopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, rising fuel, utility,\nand food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also\nexpect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or\nall of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q2 2023. Net Sales\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\nwhere we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping\nfees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022\n\n2023\n\nNet Sales:\nNorth America\n\n$\n\n69,244\n\n$\n\n28,759\n18,441\n116,444\n\nInternational\nAWS\nConsolidated\n\n$\n\n76,881\n\n$\n\n29,123\n21,354\n127,358\n\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):\nNorth America\n\n8%\n\n11 %\n\nInternational\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\nAWS\n\n37\n\n16\n\n7\n\n9\n\nConsolidated\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\nNorth America\n\n8%\n\nInternational\n\n0\n\n9\n\n37\n\n16\n\n9\n\n11\n\nAWS\nConsolidated\n\n11 %\n\nNet sales mix:\nNorth America\nInternational\nAWS\nConsolidated\n\n59 %\n\n60 %\n\n25\n16\n100 %\n\n23\n17\n100 %\n\nSales increased 9% in Q1 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced net sales by $2.4 billion for Q1\n2023. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d below. North America sales increased 11% in Q1 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales,\nprimarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection,\nand convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. International sales increased 1% in Q1 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increased unit sales, primarily by third-party\nsellers, advertising sales, and subscription services, partially offset by the impact of changes in\n\n25\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nforeign exchange rates. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from\nour shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced International net sales by $2.3 billion for Q1 2023. AWS sales increased 16% in Q1 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage,\npartially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts. Operating Income (Loss)\nOperating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022\n\n2023\n\nOperating Income (Loss)\nNorth America\n\n$\n\n(1,568) $\n\n898\n\n$\n\n(1,281)\n6,518\n3,669 $\n\n(1,247)\n5,123\n4,774\n\nInternational\nAWS\nConsolidated\n\nOperating income increased from $3.7 billion in Q1 2022 to $4.8 billion in Q1 2023. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure\nthan gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The North America operating income in Q1 2023, as compared to the operating loss in the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased\nunit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased technology and content costs, increased fulfillment and\nshipping costs, and growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $41 million for Q1 2023. The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased\nunit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased technology and content costs, increased fulfillment and\nshipping costs, and growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted operating loss by $174 million for Q1 2023. The decrease in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased\npayroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS\nbusiness growth, partially offset by increased sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $272 million for Q1 2023. 26\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022\n\n2023\n\nOperating expenses:\nCost of sales\n\n$\n\n66,499\n\n$\n\n67,791\n\nFulfillment\n\n20,271\n\n20,905\n\nTechnology and content\n\n14,842\n\n20,450\n\n8,320\n\n10,172\n\n2,594\n249\n112,775\n\n3,043\n223\n122,584\n\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nOther operating expense (income), net\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n$\n\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):\nCost of sales\n\n7%\n\n2%\n\nFulfillment\n\n23\n\n3\n\nTechnology and content\n\n19\n\n38\n\nSales and marketing\n\n34\n\n22\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n31\n\n17\n\n562\n\n(11)\n\nOther operating expense (income), net\nPercent of Net Sales:\nCost of sales\n\n57.1 %\n\n53.2 %\n\nFulfillment\n\n17.4\n\n16.4\n\nTechnology and content\n\n12.7\n\n16.1\n\nSales and marketing\n\n7.1\n\n8.0\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nOther operating expense (income), net\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and\ndelivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and\nmusic. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased product and\nshipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by\n$1.6 billion for Q1 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our\ncustomers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $19.6 billion and $19.9 billion in Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more\nexpensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through\nachieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We\nbelieve that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and content\u201d as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our\ninternal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. Fulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical\nstores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in \u201cFulfillment,\u201d\nAWS costs are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and content.\u201d\n\n27\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nFulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of\nproductivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by\nAmazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of\nproducts and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to\nour customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales\ncompared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased sales,\npartially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by $396 million for Q1 2023. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes\nfrom sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products\nand services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and\ninfrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other\nexpenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of\nproducts and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices\nand the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our\nprocess efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital\nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and\noperations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are\nallocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year\nperiod, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and\ninitiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure. Changes in foreign exchange rates\nreduced technology and content costs by $304 million for Q1 2023. See Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations \u2014 Overview\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the\nimportance of innovation. Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\ncommissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and\nonline advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales\nand changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we\nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased\npayroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view\nthese offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to an\nincrease in payroll and related expenses. 28\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $249 million and $223 million for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, and was primarily related to asset impairments for\nphysical store closures in Q1 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities in Q1 2023, and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense\nOur interest income was $108 million and $611 million during Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally\ninvest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income\ncorresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they\nare invested. Interest expense was $472 million and $823 million during Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of\nPart I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 3 \u2014 Leases and Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was $(8.6) billion and $(443) million during Q1 2022 and Q1 2023. The primary components of other income (expense), net\nare related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a\nmarketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(7.6) billion and $(467) million in Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, from our equity investment in Rivian. Income Taxes\nOur income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $1.4 billion, which included $2.1 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily\nattributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $948\nmillion, which included $48 million of net discrete tax expense. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Income Taxes\u201d for additional\ninformation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain\nnon-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet\nthe definition of non-GAAP financial measures.", "vector": [[-0.018886583,
