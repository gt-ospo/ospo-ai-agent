{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 40, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt:Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and\nregulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow\ncompetitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought\nenforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. For example, the European Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms\non which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other\ncompanies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a\nresult, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition\nrules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have\nadvanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to\nconsumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions\ncould be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely\naffect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of\nour assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on\nacquisitions that may reduce their value. Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational\ndamage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt\npayments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and\nrecords and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be\nbased on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law\nenforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021,\nwhich presents compliance challenges as it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also\nhave competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we\ndevote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls\ndesigned to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against\nus, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. 52\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade\nand investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S.\nexport controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified\ncountries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow\nfor government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign\nadversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense\ndiplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade\nrestrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among\nour customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm,\noperational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs,\nlegal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies\nincreasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer\nof personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\u201cDPF\u201d) has been recognized as adequate\nunder EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge\nwhich could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again\nblock the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and\nrestrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the\nEU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital\nServices Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to\nbuild and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources\nfrom other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or\nhelp our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less\nattractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if\nregulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of\ninternational data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against\nlarge technology companies, and European data protection authorities have taken action to block or remove services from their markets. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and\nregulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data. Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to\noperational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be\nconstrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and\ninquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent\nrequirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer\nand internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data\nmay require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or\ngreater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain\nfeatures and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant\npenalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. 53\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nExisting and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide\nrange of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services\nofferings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and\nonline content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code,\nincreasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings\nbeing subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants\nmay assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations,\nincluding laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and\nregulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to\ncybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving\ndigital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to\nachieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict\nopportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the\noperation of our AI services in the European market. How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments\u2019 approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business\npractices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease\nthe alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and\nother stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales\nopportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.", "vector": [[-0.041809816, -0.00043019577,
