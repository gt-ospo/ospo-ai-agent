The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should\nbe read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 29, 2023 and Part II, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. Overview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics,\nwe have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D\ngraphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data\nscience, autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nSupply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply and capacity agreements, has grown significantly due to\nrecent supply chain conditions and long lead times, complexity of our products, and changes in demand. We have entered and expect to\ncontinue to enter into supplier and capacity prepayment arrangements. We have procured substantially higher Data Center supply for the\nsecond half compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and\nGaming products. Qualification time for\n\n23\n\n\fnew products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new\nproduct introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to\nfunctionality challenges and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our\nwarranty costs, and delay further production of our architecture. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold\nmultiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply\nmix, and we may incur additional costs. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, thirdparty large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create\nvolatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases and applications. New\ntechnologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for compute infrastructure, the longterm trajectory is unknown. NVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings\nWe offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for\ncustomizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers. We entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development\nactivities. The timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting revenue, expenses and\ndevelopment timelines. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA\nDRIVE, and several other software solutions. Global Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced license requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. Following the 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including\ncertain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. We have sold alternative products in China not\nsubject to the license requirements, such as our A800 or H800 offerings. Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be\nharmed and we may be effectively excluded from all or part of the China market if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls, if\ncustomers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers\ndevelop their own internal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we\nincur significant transition costs. Any new control that impacts a wide range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on\nNVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. In addition to USG\nexport controls, the Chinese government may also impose restrictions that impact our ability to sell our products. New export controls or changes to existing controls could negatively impact our business, revenue or supply chain. While we work through the\nresiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, it is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including China, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan,\nand changes to trade requirements may negatively impact our business. 24\n\n\fFirst Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Summary\nThree Months Ended\nJanuary 29,\nApril 30, 2023\n2023\nMay 1, 2022\nRevenue\nGross margin\nOperating expenses\nIncome from operations\nNet income\nNet income per diluted share\n\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n7,192\n$\n6,051\n$\n8,288\n64.6 %\n63.3 %\n65.5 %\n2,508\n$\n2,576\n$\n3,563\n2,140\n$\n1,257\n$\n1,868\n2,043\n$\n1,414\n$\n1,618\n0.82\n$\n0.57\n$\n0.64\n\nQuarter-over-Quarter\nChange\n19 %\n1.3 pts\n(3)%\n70 %\n44 %\n44 %\n\nYear-over-Year\nChange\n(13)%\n(0.9) pts\n(30)%\n15 %\n26 %\n28 %\n\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where\nour expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.19 billion, down 13% from a year ago and up 19% sequentially. Data Center revenue was up 14% from a year ago and up 18% sequentially, led by growing demand for generative AI and large language\nmodels using GPUs based on our NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The revenue growth reflects strong demand from large consumer\ninternet companies and cloud service providers. Enterprise demand for GPU platforms was strong, although general purpose networking\nsolutions declined both sequentially and from a year ago. Gaming revenue was down 38% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects weaker demand due to the\nmacroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by the ramp of our\nnew GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for desktops and laptops based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. Professional Visualization revenue was down 53% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower sell-in to\npartners to help reduce channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by higher demand for desktop and mobile workstation\nGPUs. Automotive revenue was up 114% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects growth in sales of self-driving\nplatforms and AI cockpit solutions. OEM and Other revenue was down 51% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. These decreases were primarily driven by lower entry level\nnotebook GPU sales. Gross margin declined from a year earlier and increased sequentially. The year-on-year decline reflects lower Gaming margins and a higher\ncontribution from Automotive, partially offset by higher Data Center margins. The sequential increase reflects lower costs in Gaming and higher\nData Center margins as we ramp our Hopper architecture. Operating expenses were down 30% from a year ago and down 3% sequentially. The prior year included a termination charge of $1.35 billion for\nthe proposed Arm acquisition, and the prior quarter included fixed asset write-downs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $15.32 billion, down from $20.34 billion a year ago and up from $13.30 billion a quarter\nago. The year-on-year decrease reflects $8.04 billion in stock repurchases, partially offset by operating cash flow generation. The sequential\nincrease reflects operating cash flow generation. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. As of the end of the first quarter\nof fiscal year 2024, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. 25\n\n\fMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $4.28 billion, up 14% from a year ago, led by growing demand for generative AI\nand large language models using GPUs based on our NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The year-on-year increase reflects strong\ndemand from large consumer internet customers and cloud service providers. We launched four AI inference platforms that combine our fullstack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, large language\nmodel and other AI workloads. We announced that Google Cloud is the first cloud provider to offer the new NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU to\naccelerate generative AI application. We introduced NVIDIA AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language\nmodels and generative AI models. We also partnered with ServiceNow, Inc. to build generative AI across enterprise IT; joined with Dell\nTechnologies in Project Helix to deliver full-stack generative AI solutions to enterprises; announced a collaboration with Medtronic on an AI\nplatform for medical devices; and unveiled the NVIDIA cuLitho software library for computational lithography. Gaming revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $2.24 billion, down 38% from a year ago. The year-on-year decrease reflects\nweaker demand due to the macroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize channel inventory levels. We launched the GeForce\nRTX 4070 GPU based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. Professional Visualization revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $295 million, down 53% from a year ago, on lower sell-in to\npartners to help reduce channel inventory levels. We announced six new GPUs based on the NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace architecture. We\nannounced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure, for the development and deployment of industrial\nmetaverse applications, and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft to connect Microsoft 365 applications with NVIDIA Omniverse. Automotive revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $296 million, up 114% from a year ago on growth in sales of self-driving\nplatforms and AI cockpit solutions. We announced that electric vehicle maker BYD Auto Co. Ltd. will extend its use of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin\ncentralized compute platform across more of its fleet.

The revenue growth reflects strong demand from large consumer internet companies and cloud\nservice providers. Enterprise demand for GPU platforms was strong, although general purpose networking solutions declined from a year ago. Self-driving platforms and AI cockpit solutions revenue also increased from a year ago. Graphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects weaker Gaming demand due to the macroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to\nnormalize channel inventory levels, and lower Professional Visualization sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels. Concentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 67% and 77% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years\n2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be\nattributable to end customers in a different location. 27\n\n\fNo direct customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023. However, our estimated\nCompute & Networking end customer demand is concentrated among a few large cloud service providers and consumer internet companies. Some of these large companies do not purchase directly from us but often purchase through several system builders and channel partners. We\nexpect this trend will continue. Gross Margin\nOur overall gross margin decreased to 64.6% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 from 65.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, reflecting\nlower margins of GeForce GPUs within our Graphics segment partially offset by higher margins and increased contribution from compute\nproducts within our Compute & Networking segment.", "vector": [[0.052736033, 0.00207026,
