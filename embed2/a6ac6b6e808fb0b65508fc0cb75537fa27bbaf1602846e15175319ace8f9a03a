Our long-term funding requirements\nincrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. Our total cash and investments1 and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain\ncash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our\npayment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices,\nand selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements and/or potentially curtail planned investments. In the first quarter of 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is\nexpected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. In October 2023 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company\u2019s common stock, which will be payable on December 1, 2023, to\nshareholders of record as of November 7, 2023. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination\nof our Board of Directors. In the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of\noutstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement, extending the\nmaturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources of\nliquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of\ndebt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and\nfinancing receivables were in investment-grade securities.

Cash used for investing activities was higher in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the\ndivestiture of our NAND
