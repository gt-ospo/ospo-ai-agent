Additional risks, trends and uncertainties\nnot presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or\nreputation. Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. Our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry\nstandards. Our success depends on our ability to:\n\u2022\n\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that\nmeet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological\ninnovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies;\n\n\u2022\n\ndevelop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\n\n\u2022\n\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including standalone software, cloud solutions, and software-, infrastructure-, or\nplatform-as-a-service solutions;\n\n\u2022\n\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\n\n\u2022\n\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards;\n\n\u2022\n\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\n\n\u2022\n\ndevelop, acquire, and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including our acquisitions\nintegrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and\n\n\u2022\n\ncomplete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities. 32\n\n\fWe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful\nrevenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and\nprovide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent\nus from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will\nprovide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. We offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for\ncustomizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers, and we entered\nand may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. The\ntiming and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting revenue, expenses and development\ntimelines. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone\nsoftware solutions including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other software solutions. These new\nbusiness models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. We may incur\nsignificant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a\nquarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, there could be a\nsignificant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied\nacross our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\nbusiness needs or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be\nimpeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. In periods of shortages impacting the\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity,\nwhich have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same\nrate or at all if our revenue declines. Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand\nfor our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\nincluding:\n\u2022\n\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n\n\u2022\n\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\n\n\u2022\n\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\n\u2022\n\ntime to market;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\n\n33\n\n\f\u2022\n\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\n\u2022\n\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and AI cloud service offerings;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining; or\n\n\u2022\n\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage. Our supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply and capacity agreements, has grown significantly due to\nrecent supply chain conditions and long lead times, complexity of our products, and changes in demand. We have entered and expect to\ncontinue to enter into supplier and capacity prepayment arrangements. We have procured substantially higher Data Center supply for the\nsecond half compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply and\ncapacity commitments are misaligned with demand for our products. Our demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and can negatively\nimpact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship\nand support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may impair our ability to\npredict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners\nreducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have\nexperienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and\nwe may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new\nproduct architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product\nquality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay further production of our architecture. While we have managed prior\nproduct transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, and we may incur\nadditional costs. We sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made\nby our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products\nhave impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates\nprovided by various downstream parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers\nmay experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be\ndamaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a\ncomplex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader\nrevenue impact. If we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation\n\n34\n\n\fpenalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms,\nwell in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of\nthese impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these\nfactors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as our Omniverse platform, thirdparty large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create\nvolatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases and applications. New\ntechnologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical\ntensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and\ncan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years\nago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government\ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has\nimpacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand\nfor our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have\nreduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously\nintroduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address\ndemand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace GPU architectures no\nlonger include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which\nalso makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution\nchannels. Additionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications\nthat leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as\nGeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our\nplatforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our\ncustomers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand. Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or\ntrade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital\nexpenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and\nspending, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\n\n35\n\n\f\u2022\n\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin\nand may continue to do so;\n\n\u2022\n\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the\nfuture reduce our margins;\n\n\u2022\n\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers\u2019 or our licensees\u2019 inability to supply products\nto customers and/or end users;\n\n\u2022\n\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties, or other third\nparties we rely on; reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, or file for bankruptcy\nprotection and potentially cease operations; lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could\nadversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\n\n\u2022\n\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse\nimpacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the\nvalue of our financial instruments. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures, or concerns or\nspeculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our\ncustomers\u2019 ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors\u2019 ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to\nfulfill our own obligations. Additionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit,\nliquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets as\ndescribed above. A majority of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. A decline in global financial markets for long\nperiods or a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher\ninterest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity, or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an\nunrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges. Product, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, have the potential to disrupt our operations, reduce\nour expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or\nhardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more\ndifficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become\nmore prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if\nrestoring from backups is delayed or not feasible. Individuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors\nnow engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more\nautomated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third\nparties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services\nand products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors, or other third-party\nservice providers. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems,\nincluding without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which\nexposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business\n\n36\n\n\fdisruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners\u2019 supply chains have not been\ncompromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology\nsystems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We may also\nincorporate third party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms; these datasets may be flawed, insufficient,\nor contain certain biased information. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party data suppliers for our\nAI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information\nsecurity measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult\nbecause we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. Additionally, we are\nincorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a\nsignificant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business. To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is\nexpected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security\nawareness initiatives, to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security\nrequirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security\nawareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent\nthreats or detect all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats\nand techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in\ndeveloping and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and\nfinancial harm. We hold confidential, sensitive, personal, and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our\nsecurity measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or\nconfidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially\nresulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including\nfinancial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our\nGFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage\nboth us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident,\nwhich has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including\ngovernment enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification\nobligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain,\nand ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins\nor lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. In addition to\nexperiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or\nother means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business. Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military\nactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located\nin California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and\ndevelopment systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase\neconomic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or\n\n37\n\n\fadverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea\nand Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing\nregulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global\nmarkets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of\nIsrael, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic\nboycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any\nreason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic,\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being\nlocated and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party\nsystems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and\nsubstantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future\nsales and operating results. Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from cloud service providers, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we\nrely for any reason, including the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to\nprovide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure\nto damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages and other performance and quality problems may increase.", "vector": [[0.014354301, -0.041933324, -0.04697548, -0.023327377, 0.05650515, 0.007485098, 0.04724837, -0.039071374, 0.010867283, 0.022277078, 0.00736454, -0.01450893, 0.0004665082,
