(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable\nterms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with\nrenewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated\ntiming and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. (4) Excludes approximately $5.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of\npayment, if any. 13\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nIn August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt,\nsubject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand. Other Contingencies\nWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as\nsales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax\ncontroversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on\ntransactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the\ninherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such\ncontroversies may be materially different from our expectations. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial\nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in\nItem 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2023, as supplemented by the following:\nIn December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled\n\u201cNetwork Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol\u201d; and 7,233,978, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network\nSeparate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. In July 2023, Kove alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon\nWeb Services could be subject to $517 million to $1.03 billion in damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously\nin this matter. In May 2023, Dialect, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District for Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled products and services, such as Echo devices, Fire\ntablets, Fire TV sticks, Fire TVs, Alexa, and Alexa Voice Services, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,693,720 and 9,031,845, each entitled \u201cMobile Systems and\nMethods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance\u201d; 8,015,006, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Processing Natural Language Speech\nUtterances with Context-Specific Domain Agents\u201d; 8,140,327, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Filtering and Eliminating Noise from Natural Language\nUtterances to Improve Speech Recognition and Parsing\u201d; 8,195,468 and 9,495,957, each entitled \u201cMobile Systems and Methods of Supporting Natural\nLanguage Human-Machine Interactions\u201d; and 9,263,039, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance.\u201d The\ncomplaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of\nwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other\nintellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes,\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to\nour operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that\ncould affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and\nchanges to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such\nan estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been\nincorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.2 years as of June 30, 2023. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified\nredemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $61.4 billion and\n$59.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), which matures in January\n2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan\u2019s\nmaturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75% to 1.05%. As of June 30, 2023, $8.0 billion of the Term Loan was outstanding,\nwhich was included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had an interest rate of 5.9%. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we may from time to time\nincrease in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $972 million of\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.3%, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, we have pledged $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our\nCredit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and\nJune 30, 2023. We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the \u201cCommercial Paper Programs\u201d) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured\ncommercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to \u20ac3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed\n397 days from the date of issue. There were $6.8 billion and $4.4 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31,\n2022 and June 30, 2023, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective\ninterest rate, including issuance costs, of 4.5% and 5.0%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate\npurposes. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), with a term that extends to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit\nAgreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the\ncredit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. 15\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nWe have a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cShort-Term Credit Agreement\u201d), which matures in\nNovember 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances\nunder the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a\ncommitment fee of 0.05% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022\nand June 30, 2023. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes.
