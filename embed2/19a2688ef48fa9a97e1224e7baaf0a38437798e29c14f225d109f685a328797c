{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 27, "chunk_text": "These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection,\npricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption,\nenvironmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the\nprovision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to\nour facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services,\nproduct labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such\nas property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such\nas the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number\nof jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws,\nregulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on\nclaims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon\u2019s European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use\nof data, fulfillment services, and featured offers, and legislative and regulatory initiatives in Europe and elsewhere allow authorities to restrict or prohibit\ncertain operations or actions pre-emptively without the need to assess specific competitive effects. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations\nby government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by\nthem, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines),\ndiminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a\nmanner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media,\npolitical, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and\nthreatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide\nrange of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data\nprotection, data security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services,\nand operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a\npre-emptive basis. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of\nmanagement resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant\nuncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and\nunpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be\nmaterial. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a\nsettlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain\nproducts or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or\notherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.", "vector": [[0.07878928, 0.10418361,
