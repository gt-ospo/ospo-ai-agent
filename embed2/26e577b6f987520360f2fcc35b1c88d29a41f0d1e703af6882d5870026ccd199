{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 13, "chunk_text": "The SEC\nhas defined a company\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key\naccounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional\ninformation, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and\nSupplemental Disclosures\u201d of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Accounting Policies and\nSupplemental Disclosures,\u201d of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon\ninformation presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost\nand net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These\nassumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2022, we would have recorded\nan additional cost of sales of approximately $405 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on\nforecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,\nprinciples, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other\nconditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur\nduring the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to\n\n21\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nchange due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\nbusinesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in\njurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in\njurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nchanges in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the\nglobal tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively\npursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for\nwhich that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these\nproceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations,\nand any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2021\n\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nTwelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n\n$\n\n7,313\n\n$\n\n11,404\n\n$\n\n24,241\n\n$\n\n17,579\n\n$\n\n54,671\n\n$\n\n39,665\n\nInvesting activities\n\n(14,828)\n\n(15,608)\n\n(45,574)\n\n(26,780)\n\n(62,611)\n\n(39,360)\n\nFinancing activities\n\n(2,776)\n\n3,016\n\n9,391\n\n9,632\n\n7,575\n\n6,532\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at\nfair value, were $96.0 billion and $58.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $22.7 billion and\n$11.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese\nYen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $7.3 billion and $11.4 billion for Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $24.2 billion and $17.6 billion for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer,\nenterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment\nprocessing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other\nactivities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The decrease in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily\ndue to changes in working capital, as well as changes in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject\nto many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment\nterms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from\nproperty and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and\npurchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(14.8) billion and $(15.6) billion for Q3 2021 and\nQ3 2022, and $(45.6) billion and $(26.8) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, with the variability caused primarily by purchases,\nsales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $14.8 billion and $15.0 billion during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $38.9 billion\nand $42.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of\nwhich is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect to continue these investments over time,\nwith increased spending on technology infrastructure and decreased spending on our fulfillment network in 2022. We made cash payments, net of acquired\ncash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $654 million and $885 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $1.6 billion and $7.5 billion for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. We funded the\n\n22\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nacquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand. We expect to fund the acquisitions of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) and iRobot Corporation with\ncash on hand.", "vector": [[0.01824232, 0.06913496, -0.15973039, -0.008294804, 0.0027677477, -0.035211463, 0.050963636, -0.044814065, 0.060604077,
