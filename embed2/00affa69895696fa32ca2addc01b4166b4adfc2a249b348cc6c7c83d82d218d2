{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_text": "The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2022, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased investments\nin our fulfillment network and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels. The increase in fulfillment\ncosts in absolute dollars for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased\ninvestments in our fulfillment network and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and increased\nwage rates and incentives. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by $810 million for Q3 2022, and by $1.7 billion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2022. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes\nfrom sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products\nand services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and\ninfrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other\nexpenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of\nproducts and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our\nprocess efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital\nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and\noperations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are\nallocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2022 and for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for\nexpanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology\ninfrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and\nnetworking equipment. See Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Overview\u201d of our\n2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. See Item 1 of Part I,\n\u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures \u2014 Use of Estimates\u201d for additional information on the change in\nestimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\ncommissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and\nonline advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales\nand changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we\nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2022 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the comparable\nprior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities and higher marketing\nspend. 27\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view\nthese offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2022 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the\ncomparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $(11) million and $165 million for Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $38 million and $504 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, and was primarily related to impairments of property and equipment and operating leases in 2022 and the\namortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense\nOur interest income was $119 million and $277 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $330 million and $544 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2022. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed\nincome securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the\ngeographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $493 million and $617 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September\n30, 2021 and 2022, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was $(163) million and $759 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $2.8 billion and $(13.4) billion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2022. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity\nwarrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.1 billion in Q3\n2022, and $(10.4) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, from our equity investment in Rivian. Income Taxes\nOur income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $4.2 billion, which included $1.7 billion of net discrete tax benefits\nprimarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and audit-related developments. Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity\ninvestment in Rivian. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Income Taxes\u201d for additional information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain\nnon-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet\nthe definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property\nand equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.", "vector": [[0.041470516, 0.07932132, -0.17345762, -0.030277623, 0.019451253, 0.0051655397, 0.06254853, -0.030626746, 0.048684023, -0.0100822095, -0.053947885, 0.02009755,
