{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 MSFT.txt:The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which\ninputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three\nlevels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\u2022\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments\ninclude U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities\ninclude those actively traded on exchanges. 9\n\n\fPART I\nItem 1\n\n\u2022\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\nthe assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present\nvalue using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward\nand spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency\nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal\nsecurities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward,\noption, and swap contracts. \u2022\n\nLevel 3 \u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques,\nincluding option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in\ncorporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to\nan impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are\ndetermined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,\nand discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Contract Balances and Other Receivables\nAs of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, other receivables due from suppliers were $717 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and are\nincluded in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.3 billion and $3.8\nbillion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings\nthrough a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, our financing receivables, net were\n$2.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and\nother long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts,\nhistorical experience, and other currently available evidence. Employee Severance\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of\nfiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to\nthese job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were included in general and\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin.
