{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt:One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and 17% of total revenue for the third\nquarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 13% and\n10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily\nattributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute & Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain\nconcentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple\noriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demand\nincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners\nmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large\ncustomers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries\u2019 trade restrictions, or\nany difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\nactions may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business\nacquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\n\n41\n\n\femployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,\nand may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our\nemployees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have\ndesigned to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we\nare subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further\nrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators\nworldwide, including the European Union, the United States, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information\nfrom us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into\ncompetition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding our\nsales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Revisions to laws or\nregulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import\nduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or\nplan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,\ndecrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material\nadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.\nlaws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control\nmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year\n2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted End\nCustomer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future. The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and\nservices capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and\nservice offerings. Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI\napplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be\nused for training, refining, and deploying large language models. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of\ndownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and\nnegatively impact our business and financial results. Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI\ntechnologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are\nincreasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral\ncontrols restricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls\nhave been and may again be very broad in scope and\n\n42\n\n\fapplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could\nnegatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to\nserve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results.", "vector": [[0.012131035, 0.10862396, -0.1326655, 0.027757885, 0.056329787, 0.060077645, 0.003759315,
