The complaints allege similar purported classes of Illinois residents who allegedly had biometric identifiers collected from\nphotographs stored in an Amazon Photos account. The complaints seek certification as class actions, an unspecified amount of damages, injunctive relief,\nattorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the \u201cICA\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.\u00e0\nr.l., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy\ninfringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of \u20ac1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending\nconclusion of all appeals. We believe the ICA\u2019s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other\nintellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes,\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. 14\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nThe outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to\nour operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that\ncould affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and\nchanges to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such\nan estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been\nincorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.0 years as of March 31, 2023. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified\nredemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $61.4 billion and\n$62.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), which matures in January\n2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan\u2019s\nmaturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75% to 1.05%. As of March 31, 2023, $8.0 billion of the Term Loan was outstanding,\nwhich was included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had an interest rate of 5.7%. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we may from time to time\nincrease in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $972 million of\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.1%, respectively. As\nof December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, we have pledged $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our\nCredit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and\nMarch 31, 2023. 15\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nWe have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the \u201cCommercial Paper Programs\u201d) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured\ncommercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to \u20ac3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed\n397 days from the date of issue. There were $6.8 billion and $7.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31,\n2022 and March 31, 2023, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective\ninterest rate, including issuance costs, of 4.5% and 4.7%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate\npurposes. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), with a term that extends to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit\nAgreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the\ncredit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cShort-Term Credit Agreement\u201d), which matures in\nNovember 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances\nunder the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a\ncommitment fee of 0.05% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022\nand March 31, 2023. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of borrowings outstanding under\nthese facilities as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. In\naddition, we had $8.5 billion of unused letters of credit as of March 31, 2023.", "vector": [[-0.029245786, 0.018281966, -0.09924803, -0.037368126, -0.045678113, -0.02482273, -0.019139772,
