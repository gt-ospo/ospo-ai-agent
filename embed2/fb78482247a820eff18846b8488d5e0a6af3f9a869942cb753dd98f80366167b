{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 36, "chunk_text": "Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and\nretaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and\nleaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment\nthat enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit\ninternationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and\nprofessional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may\nbe adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of\nknowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws\nare interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our\nworkforce needs. Our global workforce is primarily non-unionized, but we have several unions and works councils outside of the United\nStates. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. While Microsoft has not\nreceived such petitions in the U.S., the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational\nchanges necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives. 60\n\n\fPART II\nItem 2\n\nITEM 2.
