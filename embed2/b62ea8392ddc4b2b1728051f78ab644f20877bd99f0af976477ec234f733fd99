{"text_path": "text/2023 Q2 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 9, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q2 AMZN.txt:Our income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $2.1 billion, which included $3.2 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily\nattributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion,\nwhich included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits, consisting of $805 million resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated\nwith our 2022 U.S.\n\n17\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nfederal R&D credit and a related increase in our foreign income deduction tax benefit, partially offset by discrete tax expense related to shortfalls from stockbased compensation. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $3.6 billion and $4.4 billion for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 and 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, tax contingencies were approximately $4.0 billion and $5.0 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and\nuncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income\ntax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019\ntax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These\nexaminations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination\nas well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the\nUnited Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular\njurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and\ncharacterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (\u201cLTA\u201d) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the\nU.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA\u2019s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In February 2023, we received a decision by the Indian tax authority (\u201cITA\u201d) that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will\nneed to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is resolved, which payments could be significant in the\naggregate. We believe the ITA\u2019s decision is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If\nthis matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.", "vector": [[0.07108279, 0.033552382, -0.1326724, -0.0335277,
