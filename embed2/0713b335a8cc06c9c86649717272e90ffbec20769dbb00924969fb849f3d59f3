{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 NVDA.txt:During the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. On October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding\nIsrael) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an\nultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements\nwere effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out\nof China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and\nsupply and distribution operations,\n\n43\n\n\fas well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulationcompliant solutions, including those for which the USG does not wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a\ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG\nwill grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. The USG is evaluating license requests in\na non-public process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on\nNVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that\nare not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and\nour competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls,\nincluding further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if\ncustomers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG\ndoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG\ngrants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The\nlicensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support\nefforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor\nsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control\nrules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to\ndevelop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG is seeking to impose conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to\ncreate and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or\nimpair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs,\nand if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution\nchain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our\nsupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls\nrestricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our\nGPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of\ndownstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely\nhave a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope\nof such control.", "vector": [[0.014477478, 0.080875, -0.15358758, 0.016534653, 0.05180133, 0.013864328, 0.03134457, -0.036058947, 0.04827641, 0.005569464, 0.038909517, 0.0634992,
