{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q1 AMZN.txt:The\nevents and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results),\ncash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or\nuncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors\ndiscussed in Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in the risk factors below, global\neconomic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks\ndiscussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse\neffect on us. Business and Industry Risks\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition,\nand in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services,\nelectronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater\nresources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,\nfulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as\nour competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our\nbusiness. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and\ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and\nservice offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of\nwhich could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,\nwhich can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by,\nservice disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we\nmay not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the\nbenefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In\naddition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new\ntechnologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market\nsegments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish,\ndevelop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a\nsustained basis. 35\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\n\nlocal economic and political conditions;\n\n\u2022\n\ngovernment regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade\nprotection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n\n\u2022\n\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including\nuncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices\nregarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\n\u2022\n\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\n\n\u2022\n\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\n\u2022\n\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n\n\u2022\n\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n\n\u2022\n\nlaws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments,\nadvertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\n\u2022\n\nlower levels of use of the Internet;\n\n\u2022\n\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n\n\u2022\n\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n\n\u2022\n\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\n\u2022\n\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\n\n\u2022\n\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government\nofficials and other third parties;\n\n\u2022\n\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\n\n\u2022\n\ngeopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through\nadoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on,\nthe local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit\nour international growth. The People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) and India regulate Amazon\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 businesses and operations in country through regulations and\nlicense requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors,\n(ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and\ncybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to\nprovide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail\ntrading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver\nto customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these\nstructures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional\nchanges in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the\ninterpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our\nChinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China,\nenforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in\nthe interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having\nlicenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or\nunforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary\n\n36\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nfears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or\ngeopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock\npopular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we\noverstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce\nprofitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments\nnecessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand,\nwe may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of\ngoods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and\ncustomer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the\nseasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high\ndemand. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest\nlevel (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores\nand the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases\nand third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting\nin a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the\nfuture require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from\ncollecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different\nfrom the sellers\u2019 descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling\ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are\ncircumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful\nactivities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party\nseller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third\nParties\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as\ncritical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our\nemployees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our\nproducts and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business.", "vector": [[0.06412759, -0.025499722, -0.05551757, -0.0028584623, -0.011511105,
