{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 MSFT.txt:The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which\ninputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three\nlevels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\u2022\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments\ninclude U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities\ninclude those actively traded on exchanges. \u2022\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\nthe assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present\nvalue using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward\nand spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities,\nforeign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our\nLevel 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap\ncontracts. \u2022\n\nLevel 3 \u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including\noption pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes\nand bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment\ncharge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are\ndetermined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,\nand discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. 9\n\n\fPART I\nItem 1\n\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nAs of both September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion\nand is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were\n$10.2 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings\nthrough a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, our financing receivables, net\nwere $4.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets\nand other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled\naccounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. NOTE 2 \u2014 EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential\ncommon shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock\noptions and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:\n(In millions, except earnings per share)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n\n2023\n\nNet income available for common shareholders
