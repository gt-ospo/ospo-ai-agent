Each industry shift is an\nopportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft,\nwe push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address\nthe changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\nsoftware and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors\ncustomers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of\ncloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The\ninvestments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating\nmargins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent\nworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in\nresources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are\nvery few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor\nbecomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a\nsimilar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and\nexpenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international\noperations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our\ninvestments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our\nhardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we are reducing our overall workforce by approximately 10,000\njobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we are eliminating roles in\nsome areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth\nand long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our\nworkspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in\nfuture periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven\nby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is\ndriven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. 32\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that\nincreased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should\nincrease the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate\nwas effective beginning fiscal year 2023.", "vector": [[0.016602768, -0.020374697, -0.13882335, -0.045102373, 0.020668488, 0.018929575, 0.008916246, 0.02700681,
