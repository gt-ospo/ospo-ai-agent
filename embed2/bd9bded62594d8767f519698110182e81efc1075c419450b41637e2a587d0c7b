Each industry shift is an\nopportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft,\nwe push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address\nthe changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\nsoftware and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors\ncustomers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of\ncloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing\nenvironment. The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our\noperating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to\nmeet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability\nof permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d) and other\ncomponents. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the\nability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our\nproducts contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our\nability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent\nworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in\nresources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and\nexpenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue and\nexpenses from our international operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven\nby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven\nby the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Reportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More\nPersonal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 16 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to\nFinancial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). 31\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nMetrics\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We\ndisclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the\ncontinued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how\ncustomers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, revising our\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue metric to include revenue growth and expanding our Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers metric to include Microsoft\n365 Basic subscribers, aligning with how we manage our business. Commercial\nOur commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the commercial\nportion of LinkedIn, Enterprise and partner services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the\noverall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.
