{"text_path": "text/2023 Q1 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_text": "Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties\nfrom acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license\nour proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the\nexpenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect\nour rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently\ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual\nproperty rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial\nand managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses\nfrom third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been\namplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. 37\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or\nmalfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their\ncontent in our service. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are\nexposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record\nsignificant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate\nfluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros,\nand Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may\nbe materially less than expected and vice versa. Operating Risks\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our\ninfrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management,\npersonnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases\nthese factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion\nof our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the\ncontinued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic, business, and\ngeopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global\neconomies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\u2022\n\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers\u2019 demands;\n\n\u2022\n\nour ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\n\n\u2022\n\nour ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;\n\n\u2022\n\ntiming, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material\nadverse impact on our operating results;\n\n\u2022\n\nvariations in the mix of products and services we sell;\n\n\u2022\n\nvariations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;\n\n\u2022\n\nfactors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to\nsustainability, customers, employees, or other topics);\n\n38\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\n\n\u2022\n\nincreases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and\ntechnology infrastructure products, including as a result of inflationary pressures;\n\n\u2022\n\nconstrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and\nunconstrained access to our online services;\n\n\u2022\n\nour ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or\notherwise tailor our product and service offerings;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer\nintrusions, outages, and similar events; and\n\n\u2022\n\ndisruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change),\ngeopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental\nactions impacting us and our third-party sellers in China or other foreign countries), and similar events. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers\nFailures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data\ncenters successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment\ncharges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different\nrequirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance\nproducts are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment\nnetwork and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase\npayroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and\noperating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory\nfulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment\nnetwork or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable\nterms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation\nsystems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition,\nour ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused\ndisasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade\ndisputes, and similar events. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal\ninformation, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019\ntechnology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating\nresults; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and\nconsumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content\ndelivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have\na material adverse\n\n39\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\neffect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes\ndesigned to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate\nas intended or be circumvented. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from\nefficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our\nproducts and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of\nour systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as\nnatural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security\nissues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy\nshortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from\naccepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to\ncompensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our\nBusiness\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has\nhistorically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer\nscientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our\nemployees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies\u2019 policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified\npersonnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain,\nand manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure\nto successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our\nbusiness and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase\nour payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our\noperational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived\nnegatively and harm our business and reputation. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to\nour sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our\nsuppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by\nour current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including\nas a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health\ncrises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable\nterms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others,\nor our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation,\nlimit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. 40\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic\nalliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services,\nas well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity,\npersonnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop\nthe components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection,\npayment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under\ncertain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, when the other company\u2019s offerings are not\nsuccessful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into\nadditional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we\nprovide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into\namendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our\noperating results. Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:\n\u2022\n\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\n\u2022\n\nimpairment of other relationships;\n\n\u2022\n\nvariability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n\n\u2022\n\ndifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional\ncompanies. These transactions involve risks such as:\n\u2022\n\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\n\u2022\n\nproblems retaining key personnel;\n\n\u2022\n\nadditional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of\nany integration of operations;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving\nanticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other\nadministrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;\n\n\u2022\n\nlosses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee\u2019s financial performance into our\nfinancial results;\n\n\u2022\n\nfor investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for\nwhich we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee\u2019s accounting, financial reporting,\nand similar systems, controls, and processes;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\n\u2022\n\npotential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\n\n41\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\n\u2022\n\nfor foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political,\nand regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or\namortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms,\nif at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have\nexperienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Face Significant Inventory Risk\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed\nto significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles\nand pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products,\nspoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we\nbegin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and\naccurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be\nreturnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell\nproducts in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely\naffect our operating results. We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct\ndebit from a customer\u2019s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer\nto our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to\nimplement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For\ncertain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and\nlower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of\ncredit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or\nunable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less\nfavorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and\nrules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with\nthese rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems,\ncould result in our being liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card\npayments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be\nadversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to\nthird parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing,\nregulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or\nprocessing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money\nlaundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and\nelectronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and\ncriminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks\ndescribed elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\u2022\n\nchanges in interest rates;\n\n\u2022\n\nconditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n\n\u2022\n\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\n42\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\n\u2022\n\nfluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n\n\u2022\n\ntransactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees\nor grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders,\nor both. Legal and Regulatory Risks\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and\nomnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and\nservices that we offer or sell.", "vector": [[0.028622065, -0.024894003, -0.13500835, -0.010357679, 0.05191983, 0.02516442, -0.031536255, 0.012916948, 0.017301358, -0.03573689,
