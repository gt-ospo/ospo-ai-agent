{"text_path": "text/2023 Q3 AMZN.txt", "chunk_index": 13, "chunk_text": "From text/2023 Q3 AMZN.txt:Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term\ndebt of $12.4 billion and $216 million for Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $43.9 billion and $17.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance\nleases, and financing obligations of $9.4 billion and $9.2 billion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $34.2 billion and $26.5 billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $131 million and $183 million during Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and\n$358 million and $431 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities, $567 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial\npaper programs, $972 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, and $5.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional information. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in\nthe U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the\nU.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development\nexpenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily\nequipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and\ndevelopment expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. As a result, we\nexpect the cash taxes we pay in 2023 to increase significantly. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $742 million and $2.6 billion for Q3 2022 and Q3 2023,\nand $4.3 billion and $7.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $365 million and $476 million. See\nItem 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 5 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional discussion\nof our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for\ninventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open\npurchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing\narrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs\nand cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or\ndebt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies\nare contributing to rising interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future\nborrowing costs. 23\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nResults of Operations\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates\nits business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 8 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d\nOverview\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and\ngeopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel,\nutility, and food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also\nexpect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or\nall of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q4 2023. Net Sales\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\nwhere we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping\nfees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions.

For\na discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d below. North America sales increased 11% in Q3 2023, and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were\ndriven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. 24\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nInternational sales increased 16% in Q3 2023, and 9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods,\nprimarily due to increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by\nour continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased\nInternational net sales by $1.4 billion for Q3 2023, and reduced International net sales by $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. AWS sales increased 12% in Q3 2023, and 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales\ngrowth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.
