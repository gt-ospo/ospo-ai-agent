MD&A\n\n42\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nOther Key Information\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not\nentirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and\ncommodity prices refer to \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A in our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nRisk Factors\nThe risks described in \"Risk Factors\" within Other Key Information in our 2021 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022 (Q1 2022 Form 10-Q) could materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The Risk Factors section in our 2021 Form 10K, as updated by our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q, remains current in all material respects. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face\u2014our operations could also be affected by\nfactors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results\nmay not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth\nin this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections. Controls and Procedures\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial\nreporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\ncontrol system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to\ntheir costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not\noccur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on management\u2019s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended\nOctober 1, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or\nnegotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending October 1, 2022. As of October 1, 2022, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which\n$7.2 billion remained available. We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our\nemployees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon\nvesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program. Other Key Information\n\n43\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nSection 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or\ndealings with individuals or entities subject to specific U.S. economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in\ncompliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such\nsanction. From time to time, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian\nFederation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no\ngross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, Intel suspended all business operations in Russia until\nfurther notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law. On April 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the\nsanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security\nvulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any\nsuch activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.

Terms of Restricted Stock Unit. This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, including any appendix attached hereto (this Restricted\nStock Unit Agreement and such appendix, together, this \u201cAgreement\u201d), the Restricted Stock Unit Notice of Grant delivered online by logging into\nthe E*TRADE Financial Corporation website (the \u201cNotice of Grant\u201d) and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2006 Plan\u201d), as\nsuch may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the \u201cCorporation\u201d) regarding the\nRestricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) identified in your Notice of Grant. The RSUs granted to you are effective as of the grant date set forth in the\nNotice of Grant (the \u201cGrant Date\u201d). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the 2006 Plan, the terms of the 2006 Plan\nwill control. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement or in the Notice of Grant but defined in the 2006 Plan will have the same\ndefinitions as in the 2006 Plan. 2. Vesting of RSUs. Provided that you continuously serve as a member of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors from the Grant Date\nspecified in the Notice of Grant up to and onto each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the\nright to receive the number of shares of the Corporation\u2019s Common Stock, $.001 par value (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), specified in the Notice of\nGrant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on\nwhich the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) is not open, affected RSUs will vest on the next following Nasdaq business day. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as a\nmember of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined\nbelow), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled. 3. Conversion into Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable\nfollowing the vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 8 of this\nAgreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to\nenable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued\nto your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock\nrecords of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as\ndetermined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period\nwhen the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or\nyour country of residence and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation\u2019s counsel, is necessary\nto comply with securities or other regulatory\n\n-1-\n\n\frequirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued or credited to your account may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such\ntime as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and to address other administrative matters. The number of shares of Common Stock\ninto which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to\nthe 2006 Plan. 4. Termination of Service as Director. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your term of service as a director\nof the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death,\nDisablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of termination of service. 5. Death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die during your term of service as a member of the\nCorporation\u2019s Board of Directors, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 6. Disablement. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%)\nvested, if your service as a member of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors terminates due to your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 6, \u201cDisablement\u201d will be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current\nLong Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan\nmaintained by the Corporation, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the\nCorporation, \u201cDisablement\u201d will have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a\nphysical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders you incapable of performing work in your regular occupation, as determined by\nthe Corporation. Your regular occupation is the occupation you routinely perform at the time your Disablement began. 7. Retirement. If you retire from service as a member of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors at age 75 or more, or with at least seven\n(7) years of service as a member of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 8. Tax Withholding. RSUs are taxable upon vesting (as indicated in your Notice of Grant) or, if later, the date to which you have\ndeferred settlement of your RSUs. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you will make arrangements satisfactory to the\nCorporation for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or\npayment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting or vesting of RSUs or sale of Common Stock\nshares from vested RSUs (whichever is applicable).", "vector": [[0.031988107, 0.014681071, -0.15743624, 0.005260881, 0.04345516, 0.050532084, -0.03551643, 0.022741467, 0.012747084,
