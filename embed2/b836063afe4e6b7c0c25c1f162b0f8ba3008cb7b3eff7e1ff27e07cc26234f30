{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 INTC.txt", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_text": "Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement\nStarting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and former\nofficers based on Intel\u2019s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July\n2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced\ndelays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved to\ndismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of\nthose cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or\nclasses being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable\nestimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. In July 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is\nnow Intel 4.

We previously announced several organizational changes that we believe will accelerate the execution and innovation of our Company by allowing us to capture growth in both large\ntraditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. These changes include the reorganization of our business units to be positioned to capture this growth and to provide increased\ntransparency, focus and accountability. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in Q1 2022 to align to this previously announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment\ndata has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance starting in fiscal year 2022. \"Note 2: Operating Segments\u201d within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total revenues,\nand our segment operating margin (loss) presented below to our total operating margin (loss), for each of the periods presented. For additional key highlights of our results of operations, see \"A Quarter in Review.\" Client Computing\nWe are committed to advancing PC experiences by delivering an annual cadence of leadership products and deepening our relationships with industry partners to co-engineer and\ndeliver leading platform innovation. We focus on long-term operating systems, system architecture, hardware, and application integration that enables industry-leading PC experiences. We intend to embrace these opportunities by investing more heavily in the PC, ramping its capabilities even more aggressively, and designing the PC experience even more deliberately. By doing this, we believe we will continue to fuel innovation across Intel, providing a growing source of IP, scale, and cash flow.
