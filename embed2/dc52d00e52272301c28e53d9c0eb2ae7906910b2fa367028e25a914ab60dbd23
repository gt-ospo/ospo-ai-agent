Overview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics,\nwe have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D\ngraphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data\nscience, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality. Our two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply\nBecause we do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products, we are dependent on third parties to manufacture and assemble our\nproducts. Our manufacturing lead times are very long, which requires us to make estimates of customers\u2019 future demand. At the same time, we\ndo not have a guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a\nquarter or year, which has previously caused changes to expected revenue and cash flows, and which may reoccur in the future. If our estimates\nof customer\n\n24\n\n\fdemand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between\nsupply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and\nsignificantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor\nindustry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we have experienced in the past, the lead time on our orders for certain supply\nhas extended to more than twelve months, compared to a historical lead time of approximately six months. Extended lead times may continue if\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. As a result, we have paid premiums and provided deposits\nto secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs, and may need to continue to do so in the future. We may not have\nthe ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Our supply, which includes inventory on hand,\npurchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions and complexity of our\nproducts. Purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represent approximately three quarters of our total supply. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product\nreleases and announcements, competing technologies, and changes in macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and fluctuating\ninterest rates. Each of these factors has previously impacted, and can in the future impact, the timing and volume of our revenue. Our demand\npredictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our\nrevenue as we manage shipments of legacy prior architecture products and channel partners prepare and adjust to support new products. We\nhave recently begun transitioning architectures for both our Gaming and Data Center products, which may impair our ability to predict demand\nand impact our supply mix. We may experience, and have in the past experienced, reduced demand for current generation architectures when\ncustomers anticipate transitions. Although we have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, this trend may not continue\nfor current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial\nresults may be negatively impacted. Our ability to sell certain products has in the past been and can in the future be impeded if components from\nthird parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. Additionally, we sell most of our products through channel partners,\nwho sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to\nimpact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties. COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create supply and logistics constraints. The war in\nUkraine has further strained global supply chains and may in the future result in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our\nfoundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. Our products are designed for the Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive markets. The use of our GPUs for use cases\nother than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact\ndemand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, many years ago, our Gaming GPUs\nbegan to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on\ndemand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies,\ngovernment cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain\ntransactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to\nestimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented\nEthereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which\ncould negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR,\nGeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct\nminers to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new\nproducts or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products or reseller marketplaces compete with our distribution channels. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new license requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which\nincorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. The\n\n25\n\n\fnew license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance\nequal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. We are\nalso required to obtain a license to export a wide array of products, including networking products destined for certain end users and any system\nin China that can achieve single precision performance of 200 Petaops, or double precision performance of 100 Petaops, within a 41,600 cubic\nfeet envelope. We will be required to transition certain operations out of China, which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research\nand development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We have engaged with customers in China to satisfy their demand with products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new\nA800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer\nbut have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell\nproducts that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. Our revenue, profitability, cash flows, and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative\nproduct offerings, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, or if the USG does not grant licenses in\na timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or\nimpose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the\nlicensing process will make our sales and support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue\nalternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. COVID-19\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We have and expect to incur incremental expenses and related\nin-office costs as we resume onsite services. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as ongoing lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment\nefforts in China. End customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted and this impact may continue if future and\ncontinued lockdowns occur. These ongoing COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create\nsupply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global\nand regional basis. Russia\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we paused direct sales to Russia. Direct sales to Russia in fiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our\nrevenue to partners that sell into Russia may be negatively impacted due to the war in Ukraine and we estimate that in fiscal year 2022, Russia\naccounted for approximately 2% of total end customer sales and 4% of Gaming end customer sales. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023,\nwe closed business operations in Russia. Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment\nprovided at signing. 26\n\n\fThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023 Summary\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 30,\n2022\nRevenue\nGross margin\nOperating expenses\nIncome from operations\nNet income\nNet income per diluted share\n\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n\nJuly 31, 2022\n\nOctober 31,\n2021\n\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n5,931\n$\n6,704\n$\n7,103\n53.6 %\n43.5 %\n65.2 %\n2,576\n$\n2,416\n$\n1,960\n601\n$\n499\n$\n2,671\n680\n$\n656\n$\n2,464\n0.27\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.97\n\nQuarter-overQuarter Change\n\nYear-over-Year\nChange\n\n(12)%\n10.1 pts\n7%\n20 %\n4%\n4%\n\n(17)%\n(11.6) pts\n31 %\n(77)%\n(72)%\n(72)%\n\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where\nour expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $5.93 billion, down 17% from a year ago and down 12% sequentially. Data Center revenue was up 31% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was broad-based across U.S. cloud service\nproviders, consumer internet companies and other vertical industries. Sequential growth was impacted by softness in China. We started shipping\nour flagship H100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper-architecture. During the third quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions on exports of our A100 and H100-based products to China, and any\nproduct destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third-quarter revenue, with the decline largely offset by\nsales of alternative products into China. Gaming revenue was down 51% from a year ago and down 23% sequentially, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory\nlevels with current demand expectations as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continue to weigh on consumer demand. The year-on-year decrease was driven by lower GPU sales for both desktops and laptops; the sequential decline was primarily driven by lower\nGPU sales for laptops. We believe the recent transition in verifying Ethereum cryptocurrency transactions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake\nhas reduced the utility of GPUs for cryptocurrency mining. This may have contributed to increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs in certain\nmarkets, potentially impacting demand for some of our products, particularly in the low-end. Professional Visualization revenue was down 65% from a year ago and down 60% sequentially, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align\nchannel inventory levels with current demand expectations. Automotive revenue was up 86% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by revenue from self-driving solutions. OEM and Other revenue was down 69% from a year ago and down 48% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower Jetson and\nnotebook OEM sales. Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) revenue was nominal in the current and prior quarter, and $105 million in the\nthird quarter of fiscal year 2022. Gross margin for the third quarter was down 11.6% from a year earlier, primarily due to a $702 million inventory charge, largely relating to lower\nData Center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty-related benefit of approximately $70 million. Sequentially, gross margin was up\n10.1% primarily due to lower inventory charges compared with the second quarter. The $702 million inventory charge consists of approximately\n$354 million for inventory on hand and approximately $348 million for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand\nprojections. Operating expenses increased primarily due to compensation and data center infrastructure. The year-on-year increase also reflects employee\ngrowth. 27\n\n\fCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.14 billion, down from $19.30 billion a year ago and down from $17.04 billion a\nquarter ago. The year-on-year and sequential decreases reflect share repurchases and changes in operating cash flow. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we returned $3.75 billion and $9.29 billion to shareholders in the form of share\nrepurchases and cash dividends, respectively. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we had $8.28 billion remaining under our\nshare repurchase authorization through December 2023. Market Platform Highlights\nIn Data Center, we began shipping production samples of the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU; announced a multi-year collaboration with\nMicrosoft to build a cloud-based AI supercomputer; announced a multi-year partnership with Oracle to bring NVIDIA\u2019s full accelerated computing\nstack to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure; announced that Rescale is integrating NVIDIA AI Enterprise into its HPC-as-service offering; announced two\nnew large language model cloud AI services \u2014 NVIDIA NeMo LLM and NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM Service; and announced a new data center\nsolution delivering zero-trust security optimized for VMware vSphere 8. In Gaming, we began shipping GeForce RTX 4090; introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3; and expanded the GeForce NOW library with 85+ games\nbringing the total available games to 1,400+.

Graphics - The year-on-year decreases primarily reflect lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand\nexpectations as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continue to weigh on consumer demand. Concentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 64% and 71% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal year 2023, respectively, and 84% and 85% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022,\nrespectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end\ncustomers in a different location. 29\n\n\fOne customer represented 10% of our total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and was attributable primarily to the Compute &\nNetworking segment. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and for the third quarter\nand first nine months of fiscal year 2022. Gross Margin\nOur overall gross margin decreased to 53.6% and 55.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively, from 65.2%\nand 64.7% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to $702 million and\n$2.01 billion of inventory provisions in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. The third quarter of fiscal year\n2023 included a warranty-related benefit of approximately $70 million.", "vector": [[0.0078078005, -0.0031805395, -0.06176503, -0.020021755, 0.030043062, 0.03886515,
