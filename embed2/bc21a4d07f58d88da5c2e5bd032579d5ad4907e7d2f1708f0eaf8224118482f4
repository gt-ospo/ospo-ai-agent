(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable\nterms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with\nrenewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease\narrangements that are under construction, and liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year. (4) Excludes approximately $3.4 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of\npayment, if any. In addition, we are paying the previously disclosed \u20ac1.13 billion fine imposed by the Italian Competition Authority in December 2021, which we will\nseek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. In July 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) for approximately $3.9 billion, including its debt, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions. In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt,\nsubject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund these acquisitions with cash on hand. Other Contingencies\nWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and\nsimilar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the\ntaxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii)\nthe adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our\nexpectations. 13\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial\nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in\nItem 1 of Part I, \u201cFinancial Statements \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the\nperiods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, as supplemented by the following:\nBeginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington,\nprivate litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and\nvendors and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct\npurported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon\nthrough another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief,\ncivil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. In March 2022, the court in the Frame-Wilson case granted Amazon\u2019s motion to dismiss claims alleging that\nAmazon\u2019s pricing policies are inherently illegal under federal law and claims alleging competition and consumer protection violations under state law, and\ndenied Amazon\u2019s motion to dismiss claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade under federal law. In the same month, the\nDC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is subject to appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and\nintend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In October 2020, BroadbandiTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and\nservices infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each entitled \u201cVideo-On-Demand Content Delivery System For Providing VideoOn-Demand Services To TV Services Subscribers\u201d; 10,028,026, entitled \u201cSystem For Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content On TV Services Platform\nOf A Digital TV Services Provider\u201d; and 9,973,825, entitled \u201cDynamic Adjustment Of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based On Viewer Preferences For\nMinimizing Navigation In VOD Program Selection.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, BroadbandiTV alleged in its\ndamages report that, in the event of a finding of liability, Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. could be subject to\n$166-$986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the patents are invalid. This decision is subject to appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In January 2022, VideoLabs, Inc. and VL Collective IP LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of Texas.", "vector": [[0.04701831, -0.0403409, -0.1389071, -0.051611684, 0.03160073, 0.04233987, -0.037076626, 0.00038145224, -0.029112648, 0.023897253, -0.037714597, 0.019319825, 0.02900632,
