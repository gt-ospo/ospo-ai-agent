Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little\ncost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. \u2022\n\nSome companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using\nopen source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full\ncosts of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and\nfunctionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as\nfor research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class\nplatforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and\ndelivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of\nwhich cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present\nenhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must\ncontinue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate\nobstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d), a\nnetwork of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving\nubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT\nEdge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. 45\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These\ncosts will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution\nin several areas, including:\n\u2022\n\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \u2022\n\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices,\nincluding PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. \u2022\n\nContinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. \u2022\n\nEnsuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as\nwell as help them meet their own compliance needs. \u2022\n\nMaking our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including\nthose of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing\norganizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new\nproducts and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may\nnegatively impact gross margins and operating income. Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts\nthrough stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that\nviolate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to\ncontrol these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant\ninvestments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating\nsystem, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition,\nwe are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the\ndevelopment and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming\ndevices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including\ninnovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing\nsignificant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably\naffecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years,\nif at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and\nbusinesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft\nEdge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will\ncontinue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or\nproduct experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant\nproblems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. 46\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making\nacquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2022 we\ncompleted our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and in October 2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc.\n(\u201cActivision Blizzard\u201d). In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions\nand arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an\nunsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating\nand retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that\nannounced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a\nparty, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend\nin part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired\ncompanies\u2019 ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than\nexpected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the\nbenefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed. For example, the Federal Trade Commission continues to challenge our Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or unwind\nthe transaction. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We\nacquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an\nimpairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in\ncircumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in\nour stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we\nparticipate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial\nstatements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our\nresults of operations. CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation\nor competitive position. Security of our information technology\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored\norganizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide\nvariety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed\nprocesses in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and\ndatacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other\nsensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to\nlaunch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to\nplan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic\nor armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in\nunauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no\nlonger appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems or reveal confidential\ninformation. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier\naccounts or hardware. 47\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and\nsuccessfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may\nallow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed\nacross our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could\ndisrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of\ntheir data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or\ncompetitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to\nallocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also\nsubject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider\u2019s customers, including us, through software\nupdates. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new\nways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other\nconsumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for\nadversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging\ncybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud\nand on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology\nproducts and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services\nrely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our\nservices and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and\nservices, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\u2019 on-premises or cloud\nenvironments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\u201czero day\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several\nof our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches\nif customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional\nmalware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers\nembrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users\u2019\naccounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in\nunauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our products or\nservices. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that\nmay make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because\ngenerative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI\nmay be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired\nover many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate\nthe strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product,\nservice, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and\nstandards can increase our customers\u2019 vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our\ntechnology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity\npractices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for\nour products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations\nand some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. 48\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to\nnotifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help\nprotect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to\ndetect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially\nwhere an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019\ncomputing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously\nengineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software\nupdates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help\nto secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the\nintegrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and\ninformation about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services,\nhealth care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well,\nactual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our\nreputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or\nservices. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional\nproducts or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software\nor operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate\nsecurity practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims\nagainst us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these\nprovisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability\nexposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there\nis a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability\nclaims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth,\nand scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The\ncontinued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over\npersonal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper\ndisclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our\ncustomer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal\nexposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in\na cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid\nlegal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government\nauthority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of\npersonal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based\nsolutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user\nconcerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or\ngovernmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. 49\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and\nservices contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made\ncommitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may\nweaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it\nfor their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively\naffected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including\nthrough the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of\nour users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or\nresponding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be\nsuccessful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. Other digital safety abuses\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content in\nviolation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies,\nand conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and\nuser engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have\nbeen enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational\ndamage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the\nintelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The IoT\u2019s great potential also carries substantial\nrisks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their\nintended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not\ndevelop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited\ninterfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy\ncustomers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our\ntechnologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement\nactions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. 50\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our\nofferings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI\nmay be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We\nenvision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and\npersonal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI\nalgorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content\ngenerated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by\nMicrosoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or\nresult in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other\nchallenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action,\nlegal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), new applications of\nexisting data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical\nissues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or\ncustomization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other\nsocial, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated\nfinancial statements. OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations\ninfrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing\npower. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network\ninfrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and\nbuildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d) and other components. The\ncost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy\neconomy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce\nnew products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account\nservices, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the\nincorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services\nprovided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires\ndevelopment of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet\nconnectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that\ncontinue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet\nconnectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products,\nservices, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our\nreputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we\ndesign and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant\nexpenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or\naddress such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may\ncontain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions\nand multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially\nmagnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and\nrevenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although\nour license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will\nwithstand legal challenge. 51\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand\nfor hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of\nsupplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain\ntimely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development\nof our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may\nincrease our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other\ngeographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating\nmargins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.", "vector": [[0.007318702,
