{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 MSFT.txt", "chunk_index": 33, "chunk_text": "Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition,\nimpairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and\ninventories. Revenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products\nand services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant\njudgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine\nwhether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud\nservice and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency,\nand interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cSSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no\nadditional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to\ndetermine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual\nproducts and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may\nuse information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the\nexercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to\nrecognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information\nbecomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. 42\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nImpairment of Investment Securities\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate,\namong other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than\ncost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers\navailable quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific\nadverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more\nlikely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment\ncharge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions\ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the\ninvestment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic\nbasis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is\ndetermined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our\nreporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for\nimpairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and\nbetween annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating\nperformance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and\nliabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value\nof each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant\njudgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for\nour business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and\nother factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for\neach reporting unit. Research and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility\nhas been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available\nfor general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have\ndetermined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved\nthrough coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is\nincluded in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss\ncontingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we\nevaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the\namount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 43\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred\ntax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax\nreturns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements\nfrom such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is\nrequired in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax\nreturns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing\noverhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of\ncompletion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers,\nand the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development\nplans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we\nreduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 44\n\n\fPART I\nItem 3, 4\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRISKS\nWe are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to\nmanage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily\nto maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro,\nJapanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average\nmaturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broadbased indices to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nhave evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these\ndisclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter\nended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting. 45\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1, 1A\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRefer to Note 14 \u2013 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal\nproceedings in which we are involved. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating\nmargins. Competition in the technology sector\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized\nfirms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to\nentry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our\nsuccess in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse\nsolutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider\nthat can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We\nface significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. \u2022\n\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and\nrelated services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles,\nwearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the\nhardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also\nbe able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated\nhardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model\nwe increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. 46\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from\ncompeting platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices\ncompete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning\nto these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these\ndevices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract\napplication developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may\ndecrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their\ncompetitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer\n(\u201cOEM\u201d) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. \u2022\n\nCompeting platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and\nutility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to\nmove data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist\ndevelopers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal,\nand value. Efforts to compete with competitors\u2019 content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and\nlower our operating margins. Competitors\u2019 rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to\ndistribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives. Business model competition\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. \u2022\n\nEven as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the licensebased proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting\noriginal ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue\nreceived from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers\nunder this model. \u2022\n\nOther competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party\nadvertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little\ncost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. \u2022\n\nSome companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and\nearning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and\ndevelopment for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such\nas for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves\ncloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-inclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d). At the same\ntime, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and\ndelivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of\nwhich cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows\necosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability\nand eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of\nThings (\u201cIoT\u201d), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our\nsuccess in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We\nmay not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. 47\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These\ncosts will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our\nexecution in several areas, including:\n\u2022\n\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \u2022\n\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices,\nincluding PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. \u2022\n\nContinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. \u2022\n\nEnsuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as\nwell as help them meet their own compliance needs. \u2022\n\nMaking our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including\nthose of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing\norganizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new\nproducts and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may\nnegatively impact gross margins and operating income. Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts\nthrough stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that\nviolate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to\ncontrol these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make\nsignificant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows\noperating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including\nPCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors,\nincluding innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as\nproviding significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades,\nunfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for\nseveral years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new\nproducts and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain\nfeatures, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services\nwill continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or\nproduct experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or\nsignificant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. 48\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making\nacquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021\nwe completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance\nCommunications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7\nbillion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not\nadvance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations\nand challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract\nmanagement from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately\nanticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The\nsuccess of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and\nservices or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies\u2019 ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data\ngovernance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and\narrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These\nevents could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which\ncould cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a\nchange in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a\ndecline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in\nwhich we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated\nfinancial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively\naffecting our results of operations. CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation\nor competitive position. Security of our information technology\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including statesponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may\nuse a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware,\nsoftware, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social\nengineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take\nother actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of\nservice or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Nation-state attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing\nconflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system\nadministrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally\ncompromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to\nintroduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. 49\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and\nsuccessfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in\nthe environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal\nnetworks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security\nof our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in\nproduct development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result\nin theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to\nimprove technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. The cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as \u201cSolorigate\u201d or \u201cNobelium\u201d are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was\nintroduced to a software provider\u2019s customers, including us, through software updates. The attackers were later able to create false\ncredentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers\u2019 systems. We may be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as\nboth a supplier and consumer of IT. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new\nways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other\nconsumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats\nemerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud\nand on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology\nproducts and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based\nservices rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of\nour services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and\nservices, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\u2019 on-premises or cloud\nenvironments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\u201czero day\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with\nseveral of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security\npatches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install\nadditional malware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as\ncustomers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our\nusers\u2019 accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also\nresult in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our\nproducts or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source\nsoftware that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired\nover many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer\nincorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a\nproduct, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security\nadvances and standards can increase our customers\u2019 vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical\nsophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of\nthe art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining\ndefault settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other\naspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. 50\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nCyberattacks such as Solorigate/Nobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly\ncompromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available\ninformation and actions for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection,\ntracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information\non how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have\nno or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously\nengineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to\naddress security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure\ncustomers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of\nour network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information\nabout the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health\ncare, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well,\nactual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our\nreputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or\nservices. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of\nadditional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to\nrun software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt\nadequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to\nclaims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no\nassurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with\nlarger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there\nis a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability\nclaims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth,\nand scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The\ncontinued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over\npersonal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper\ndisclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our\ncustomer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal\nexposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of\nrevenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or,\nincreasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in\nresponse to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate\nlimitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the\ncollection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could\nlimit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to\naddress customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to\ncustomer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and\nservices. 51\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products\nand services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have\nmade commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law\nmay weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and\nusing it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively\naffected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations,\ndissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our\nproducts or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions\nmay require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting\nour business and consolidated financial statements. Other digital safety abuses\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our\nterms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting\nlegal frameworks. When discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and\nwe expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to\ncomply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the\nintelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The IoT\u2019s great potential also carries substantial\nrisks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their\nintended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may\nnot develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited\ninterfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy\ncustomers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our\ntechnologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement\nactions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings,\nincluding our productivity services, and we are also making first- and third-party AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they\nbuild. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the\ncloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges\nthat could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased\ninformation. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the\nacceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to\ncompetitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the\nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d), and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are\ncontroversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience\nbrand or reputational harm. 52\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations\ninfrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing\npower. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network\ninfrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and\nbuildable land, predictable energy, and networking supplies, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected by a variety of\nfactors, including the transition to a clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce\nnew products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365,\nMicrosoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of\nproviding a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this\ninfrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and\nreliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and\nreliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or\npermanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and\ncompute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by\ncustomers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and\nadvertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we\ndesign and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant\nexpenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or\naddress such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may\ncontain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business\nfunctions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances\npotentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced\nsales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these\nprovisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their\ndemand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether\nbecause of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we\nmay not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or\nobsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices,\ndatacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain,\nresulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a\nleading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments\nare actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and\nChina. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust\nauthorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. 53\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nThe European Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we\nmake certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission\nordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our\ncompetitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009,\nthe Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing\nsoftware, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in\n2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of\nthe Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may\nenable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of\nour products. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As\na result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with\ncompetition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in\nAsia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our\nsoftware to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition\nlaw actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them,\ncould adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:\n\u2022\n\nWe may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing\nalternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and\nremoving functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. \u2022\n\nWe may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market\nvalue or do not protect our associated intellectual property. \u2022\n\nWe are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other\nvoluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to\nsubstantial fines or other remedial actions. \u2022\n\nOur ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. \u2022\n\nRegulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability to consummate acquisitions or impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of\nsuch transactions. Our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by\nour employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and\nadequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports\nfrom employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we\nreceive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present\ncompliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have\ncompetition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we\ndevote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal\ncontrols designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against\nus, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. 54\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to\ntrade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries\nsuch as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to,\nor making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and\ncommunication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications\ntechnology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in\nadditional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new\nand rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative\nimpacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem\ndisruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges,\nor criminal sanctions. Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy,\ntelecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that\nour offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws,\nincluding EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more of our services as regulated\ntelecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security,\nand law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other\ninformation is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products\nand services. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict\nopportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are\ncontinuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business\npractices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged\nnoncompliant activity. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more\naccessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face\nregulatory or legal actions. 55\n\n\fPART II\nItem 1A\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased\ncosts, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies\nincreasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and\ntransfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy\nShield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the\nlegal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data protection authorities\nblocking the use of U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. The U.S. and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle\non a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. A failure of the U.S. and EU to finalize the\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers. Potential new rules\nand restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some\nmarkets. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an\nestablishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the\nhandling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital\nMarkets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and\nservices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the\ndiversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer\nproducts that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, or if our\nimplementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how\nparticular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to\ncomplaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of\nworldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of\ncustomers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws\nand regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data. Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational\nefficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way\nmay be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses,\nreviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or\ninconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of\nour customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations\nregarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower\nrevenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability\nto innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may\nresult in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management\ntime and effort.", "vector": [[0.062315498, -0.005732706, -0.090645574, -0.004272853, 0.0074799936, 0.034593638, 0.040745158, -0.042169664, 0.08892763, -0.028596839, -0.0076693944, -0.025123602,
