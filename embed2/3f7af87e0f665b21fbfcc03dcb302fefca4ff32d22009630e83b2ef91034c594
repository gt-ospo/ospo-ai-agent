Each industry shift is an\nopportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft,\nwe push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address\nthe changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\nsoftware and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors\ncustomers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of\ncloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The\ninvestments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating\nmargins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent\nworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in\nresources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are\nvery few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor\nbecomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a\nsimilar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and\nexpenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international\noperations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors\nand other risks. Seasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven\nby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is\ndriven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Change in Accounting Estimate\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that\nincreased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should\nincrease the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate\nwas effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and\nequipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended September 30, 2022, was an increase in\noperating income of $1.1 billion and net income of $859 million, or $0.12 and $0.11 per basic and diluted share, respectively. It is estimated\nthis change will increase our fiscal year 2023 annual operating income by $3.7 billion. Reportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More\nPersonal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. 31\n\n\fPART I\nItem 2\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 17 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to\nFinancial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Metrics\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We\ndisclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect\nthe continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on\nhow customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of\nthis Form 10-Q). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably\nexpanding our Surface metric into a broader Devices metric to incorporate additional revenue streams, along with other minor changes to\nalign with how we manage our businesses. Commercial\nOur commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the\ncommercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the\noverall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.

Intelligent Cloud\nrevenue increased driven by Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased driven by Office 365\nCommercial and LinkedIn. More Personal Computing revenue decreased slightly primarily driven by a decline in Windows, offset in part by\ngrowth in Search and news advertising. Cost of revenue increased $1.8 billion or 13% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud and Gaming, offset in part by a reduction in depreciation\nexpense due to the change in accounting estimate for the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Gross margin increased $3.0 billion or 9% driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes and the change in\naccounting estimate, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. \u2022\n\nGross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin\npercentage decreased 3 points driven by reductions in More Personal Computing and Intelligent Cloud.", "vector": [[0.035723034,
