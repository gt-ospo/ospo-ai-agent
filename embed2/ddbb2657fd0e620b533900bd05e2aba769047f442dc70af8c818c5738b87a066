(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable\nterms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with\nrenewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated\ntiming and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. (4) Excludes approximately $4.2 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of\npayment, if any. 13\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nIn August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary\nclosing conditions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand. Other Contingencies\nWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and\nsimilar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the\ntaxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii)\nthe adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our\nexpectations. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial\nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies \u2014 Legal Proceedings\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as\nsupplemented by the following:\nIn May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that \u201cAlexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices\u201d infringe U.S.\nPatent No. 7,177,798, entitled \u201cNatural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.\u201d The complaint seeks an injunction, an\nunspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in their\ndamages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in damages. We dispute the allegations of\nwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington\n(\u201cW.D. Wash.\u201d), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between\nAmazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust\nenrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court\nof the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of\nseveral distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by\nAmazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive\nrelief, civil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. Amazon\u2019s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and\nMarch 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts\ndismissed claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are an\nunlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal as\nof January 2023. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Beginning in May 2021, Angela Hogan and her minor child filed purported class-action complaints against Amazon.com, Inc. in the Circuit Court of\nCook County, Illinois, and against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.", "vector": [[0.025580497, -0.0054789977, -0.034685936, -0.014762079, 0.04937442, -0.007801037,
