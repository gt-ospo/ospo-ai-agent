Level 3\u2014Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar\ninstruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities\ncategorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.

(2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities primarily as collateral for\nreal estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and\nmarketable fixed income securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as \u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\u201d and of twelve months or longer\nas non-current \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.

Equity Warrants and Non-Marketable Equity Investments\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, these warrants had a\nfair value of $3.4 billion and $2.5 billion, and are recorded within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in \u201cOther\nincome (expense), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, equity investments not accounted for under the equity-method and without readily determinable fair\nvalues had a carrying value of $603 million and $831 million, and are recorded within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments\nrecognized in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.
