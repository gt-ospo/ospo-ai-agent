Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\n\n120,805\n\n\fThe following table shows the fair value of the Company\u2019s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\nDue after 1 year through 5 years\nDue after 5 years through 10 years\nDue after 10 years\n\n$\n\n$\n\nTotal fair value\n\n82,497\n14,243\n17,355\n114,095\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2022\n\nSeptember 24,\n2022\n\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts\n\n$\n$\n\n66,054\n20,125\n\n$\n$\n\n102,670\n20,125\n\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n$\n\n134,971\n\n$\n\n185,381\n\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\n\n\fThe gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 24, 2022\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\n\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\n\nTotal\nFair Value\n\nDerivative assets (1):\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n$\n\n4,317\n\n$\n\n2,819\n\n$\n\n7,136\n\nDerivative liabilities (2):\nForeign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts\n\n$\n$\n\n2,205\n1,367\n\n$\n$\n\n2,547\n\u2014\n\n$\n$\n\n4,752\n1,367\n\n(1)\n\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. (2)\n\nDerivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company\u2019s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective\ncounterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party\nto the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2022\n\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\nCurrent and non-current term debt\n\n$\n$\n\n14,311 $\n(18,731) $\n\nSeptember 24,\n2022\n\n13,378\n(18,739)\n\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which\naccounted for 11% and 10%, respectively. The Company\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 43% and 44% of total trade receivables as of December 31,\n2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers.", "vector": [[0.010754458, -0.012453531, -0.07547694, 0.0013646961, 0.050607935, 0.01350152, -0.01588702, 0.0127226645, 0.087014325,
