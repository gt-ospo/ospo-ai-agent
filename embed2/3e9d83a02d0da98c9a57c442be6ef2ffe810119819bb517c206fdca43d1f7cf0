{"text_path": "text/2022 Q3 NVDA.txt", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_text": "Cash provided by investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to cash used in the first nine months of\nfiscal year 2022, primarily driven by higher marketable securities sales and maturities, lower purchases of marketable securities, offset by higher\ncapital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022,\nwhich primarily reflects share repurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of\nOctober 30, 2022, we had $13.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt\nsecurities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities,\nas well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S.\ndollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have\nsufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future\nsupply obligations and debt due in fiscal year 2024. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to\nexternal capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our\noperations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.80 billion to $2.00 billion related to property and equipment. We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued\nany related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of October 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal\nincome taxes. We utilized nearly all our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, which has resulted in higher cash\ntax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires taxpayers to\ncapitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen\nyears. This will impact cash flows from operations and will result in significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Capital Return to Shareholders\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we returned $3.65 billion and $8.99 billion, respectively, in share repurchases\nand $100 million and $300 million, respectively, in cash dividends. From October 31, 2022 through November 17, 2022, we repurchased\n7 million shares for $1.05 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our\nBoard of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders. 32\n\n\fOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had outstanding:\n\u2022\n\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;\n\n\u2022\n\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024;\n\n\u2022\n\n$1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026;\n\n\u2022\n\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028;\n\n\u2022\n\n$1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030;\n\n\u2022\n\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2031;\n\n\u2022\n\n$1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040;\n\n\u2022\n\n$2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050; and\n\n\u2022\n\n$500 million of Notes Due 2060. We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 30, 2022, we had not issued any\ncommercial paper. Contractual Obligations\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $869 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $80 million recorded in non-current income\ntax payable as of October 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties\nin individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We\nare currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our\ncontractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022. Refer to Item 7,\n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our\noperating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements, respectively. Climate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from\nsourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022. As of October 30, 2022, there have been no\nmaterial changes, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to the financial market risks described as of January 30, 2022. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022. As of October 30, 2022, there\nhave been no material changes, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 30,\n2022. 33\n\n\fRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of October 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)\nwere effective to provide reasonable assurance. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or\nERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial\nrecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we completed the\nconsolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included updating our internal control over financial reporting. We will\ncontinue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\nNVIDIA have been detected. 34\n\n\fPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our\nlegal proceedings since January 30, 2022. Also refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 30, 2022 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal\nquarters ended May 1, 2022 and July 31, 2022. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks\ndescribed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2022 and July 31, 2022, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known\nto us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, mismatches between supply and demand can occur, harming our financial results. Because we do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products, we are dependent on third parties to manufacture and assemble our\nproducts. Our manufacturing lead times are very long, which requires us to make estimates of customers\u2019 future demand. At the same time, we\ndo not have a guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a\nquarter or year, which has previously caused changes to expected revenue and cash flows, and which may reoccur in the future. If our estimates\nof customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch\nbetween supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market\nplatforms, and significantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor\nindustry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we have experienced in the past, the lead time on our orders for certain supply\nhas extended to more than twelve months, compared to a historical lead time of approximately six months. As a result, we have paid premiums\nand provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs, and may need to continue to do so in the\nfuture. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Our supply, which\nincludes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions\nand complexity of our products. Purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represent approximately three quarters of our total supply. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product\nreleases and announcements, competing technologies, and changes in macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and fluctuating\ninterest rates. Each of these factors has previously impacted, and can in the future impact, the timing and volume of our revenue. Our demand\npredictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our\nrevenue as we manage shipments of legacy prior architecture products and channel partners prepare and adjust to support new products. We\nhave recently begun transitioning architectures for both our Gaming and Data Center products, which may impair our ability to predict demand\nand impact our supply mix. We may experience, and have in the past experienced, reduced demand for current generation architectures when\ncustomers anticipate transitions. Although we have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, this trend may not continue\nfor current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial\nresults may be negatively impacted. Our ability to sell certain products has in the past been and can in the future be impeded if components from\nthird parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. Additionally, we sell most of our products through channel partners,\nwho sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to\nimpact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties. 35\n\n\fIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our original equipment\nmanufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships\ncould be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. On the other hand, if we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, and if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to\npurchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including as a result of channel pricing programs that we have implemented in the past and may continue to\nimplement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, which has reduced our revenue and gross margins, and we may need to continue\nthese reductions. We have had to increase prices for our Data Center products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and may need to\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future, which may negatively impact demand. We have also written-down our inventory, incurred\ncancellation penalties, and recorded impairments, negatively impacting our gross margins and our overall financial results. These impacts were\namplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be\nexacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased recently, as our purchase\nobligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply while our revenue has sequentially declined. In addition to the growing lead times described above, there are many factors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either\nunderestimate or overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for\nour products. Those factors include such things as:\n\u2022\n\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in our target markets\nand/or overall economy, rising inflation, currency fluctuations, and changes in the credit market;\n\n\u2022\n\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control COVID-19 case spread;\n\n\u2022\n\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\n\u2022\n\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\n\n\u2022\n\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\n\u2022\n\nfluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or\n\n\u2022\n\nchanges in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage or cloud service providers. COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create supply and logistics constraints. The war in\nUkraine has further strained global supply chains and may in the future result in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our\nfoundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. Extended lead times may continue if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and\nwhere we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse\nimpact on us. Our products are designed for the Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive markets. The use of our GPUs for use cases\nother than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact\ndemand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, many years ago, our Gaming GPUs\nbegan to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on\ndemand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies,\ngovernment cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain\ntransactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to\nestimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented\nEthereum 2.0 merge\n\n36\n\n\fmay decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively\nimpact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum\nmining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0\nmerge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new products or previously sold products may be\nresold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products or reseller\nmarketplaces compete with our distribution channels. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as ongoing lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment\nefforts in China. End customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted and this impact may continue if future and\ncontinued lockdowns occur. These ongoing COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create\nsupply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global\nand regional basis. We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products, which reduces our\ncontrol over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could\nharm our business. We do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries\nto manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products,\nbut instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design,\nsimulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for\ngreater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we have entered in the past\nand may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity\nto address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply\nchain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin,\nrevenue and/or financial results, including:\n\u2022\n\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from\nincorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n\n\u2022\n\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test\ncapacity for our products;\n\n\u2022\n\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller\ngeometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our\nproducts;\n\n\u2022\n\nlimited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;\n\n\u2022\n\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and\ncommencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;\n\n\u2022\n\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\n\n\u2022\n\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\n\n\u2022\n\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or\nfoundries prioritize our competitors\u2019 orders over ours;\n\n\u2022\n\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;\n\n\u2022\n\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry\u2019s proprietary process technology; and\n\n37\n\n\f\u2022\n\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to heat wave closures and electricity conservation efforts. We have incurred and could in the future incur significant expenses to remediate defects in our products, which can damage our\nreputation and cause us to lose market share. Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security\nvulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials\nand/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications\nor as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in\nour products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. Although arrangements with component providers may contain\nprovisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may\noccur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product\nor service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property,\nor expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products\nor services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in\nwhich our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such\ndefect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the\nvalue of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the\nissue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or may not be satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products or\nreleases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of\ndesign wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective\ncustomers and partners and consumers\u2019 perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin,\nrevenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace\nproducts in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies. For example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products.", "vector": [[0.031988107, 0.014681071, -0.15743624, 0.005260881, 0.04345516, 0.050532084,
