## Vector DB Efficiency Eval
It is important to note that Microsoft 365 Copilot's Retrieval API uses Azure's Cognitive Search, which itself uses HNSW-based vector index retrieval (Hierarchical Navigable Small World). Microsoft has not published any testing results on public benchmarks, so I will do my best to estimate in the range of how similar ANN based systems perform at index size.
