    "# RAG-Based Chatbot Tutorial: Complete Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using the KG-RAG dataset and PACE ICE's compute resources. Unlike the conceptual tutorial, this version provides complete, executable code examples for every step.\n",

    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python: basic knowledge (for loops, method calls, generators, etc)\n",
    "- Bash: basic knowledge (for loops, variable substitution, etc)\n",
    "- Access to [PACE ICE's instance of Open OnDemand](https://ondemand-ice.pace.gatech.edu)\n",
    "  - If off-campus, use the GT VPN (or in-browser VPN) to connect\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Get Started with ICE\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be running LLMs (large language models) on ICE. The easiest way to get started with LLMs on ICE is to go to Open OnDemand, click \"Interactive Apps\" on the top navbar, and then \"Ollama + Jupyter (Beta).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Interactive Apps dropdown showing Ollama option](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d4b9deb-90f4-48f6-98b6-c1e6b163cbd0)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configure Ollama Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ollama Models Directory**: Select \"Temporary directory\" as your Ollama models directory. This directory is where the LLMs will be downloaded to. Since \"PACE shared models\" does not allow downloading additional models, we will use \"Temporary directory\" and download the models ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1397c880-1892-4987-b718-eb6d1c1eeb48' alt='dropdown for choosing Ollama models directory' width='512'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Node Type**: For the node type, select \"NVIDIA GPU (first avail).\" This will ensure you get a GPU of some sort, while making sure you won't wait too long for a specific GPU to free up.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Other Settings**: The default values can be used for everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launch Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you click submit, you should see a card like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Card showing queued job status](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9503a326-2f65-4dea-b04f-317a125c4d01)\n",
    "\n",
    "This card will become green once the environment is ready:\n",

    "#### Ollama\n",
    "Interface with local LLM models running on ICE infrastructure. This enables running powerful language models (like Llama, Mistral) locally without API costs or internet dependency. Essential for both text generation and embeddings in our RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)\n",
    "Sentence tokenization and text preprocessing. Breaks documents into meaningful sentences for semantic chunking. Proper sentence boundaries are crucial for maintaining context when splitting text - better than naive character-based splitting that might break mid-sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NumPy\n",
    "Mathematical operations on embedding vectors. Enables efficient cosine similarity calculations between embeddings. Critical for semantic chunking (comparing sentence similarities) and vector database operations. Much faster than pure Python for numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ChromaDB\n",
    "Vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings. Provides fast semantic search capabilities - instead of keyword matching, finds documents that are conceptually similar to queries. Handles the complex vector similarity math automatically and scales to large document collections.\n"

    "## Text Processing and Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Text Chunking is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Text chunking is a critical step in RAG systems because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM Context Limits**: Large language models have maximum context lengths (token limits). Even with large context windows, performance often degrades with very long inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval Precision**: When you search a vector database, you want to retrieve the most relevant pieces of information, not entire documents that may contain irrelevant sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Based on anecdotal evidence, an LLM is more likely to hallucinate if given a *lot* of unnecessary information. Therefore, to make a good RAG chatbot, we want to give the LLM the minimum amount of information that still results in a good answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Chunking Works\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to chunking text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed-length chunking**: Split text every N characters or words (simple but breaks context)\n",
    "- **Sentence-based chunking**: Split at sentence boundaries (better context preservation)\n",
    "- **Semantic chunking**: Split based on topic changes using embedding similarity (optimal context)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Chunking Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking uses embedding similarity to determine natural breakpoints in text, creating more coherent chunks than simple length-based splitting. This approach identifies topic changes by measuring the similarity between consecutive sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This chunking process is typically applied to the summarized text from the previous step, ensuring we chunk clean, relevant content rather than raw documents with formatting artifacts."

    "## Embedding Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Embeddings and Why Use Them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. In a RAG system, embeddings enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Search**: Instead of exact keyword matching, you can find documents that are conceptually related to your query\n",
    "2. **Vector Database Storage**: Embeddings allow fast similarity searches using mathematical operations like cosine similarity\n",
    "3. **Context Understanding**: Similar concepts have similar embeddings, even if they use different words\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Vector Databases Work\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database stores and retrieves text by its embedding vector, generated by an embedding model like `nomic-embed-text`. The simplified workflow (in pseudocode) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "embed(text: str) -> List[float]                         # Convert text to numbers\n",
    "vector_db_store(id: str, vector: List[float])           # Store with identifier\n",
    "vector_db_query(vector: List[float]) -> List[Document]  # Find similar\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, storing information about pies (in pseudocode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "vector_db_store('pumpkin_pie', embed('pumpkin pie'))\n",
    "vector_db_store('apple_pie', embed('apple pie'))\n",
    "vector_db_store('elderberry_pie', embed('elderberry pie'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user asks about \"pumpkins\", running `vector_db_query(embed('pumpkins'))` would return `'pumpkin_pie'` as the top result because the embeddings are mathematically similar.\n",
